## Hot & cold water piping ##

Hot and cold water piping in a bathroom refers to the system of distributing potable water to fixtures while keeping hot and cold lines separate for proper temperature control. Cold water pipes supply sinks, toilets, showers, and tubs directly from the main supply, while hot water pipes connect to a water heater and deliver heated water to showers, sinks, and bathtubs. Pipes are typically installed behind walls, under floors, or in ceilings, with a focus on minimizing bends and long runs to maintain pressure and flow. Materials commonly used include PEX, copper, or CPVC, which resist corrosion and are durable. Proper installation includes shut-off valves at each fixture, insulation on hot water lines to reduce heat loss, and correct pipe sizing to ensure balanced flow and consistent temperatures at all points of use.
