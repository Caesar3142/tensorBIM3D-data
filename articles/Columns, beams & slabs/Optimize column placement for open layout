## Optimize column placement for open layout ##

To optimize column placement for an open layout, position columns along the perimeter walls whenever possible to free up interior space and minimize visual obstruction. Use a regular structural grid to evenly distribute loads while aligning columns with walls, partitions, or built-in cabinetry so they feel integrated rather than intrusive. Increase beam spans strategically in main living areas to reduce the number of interior columns, and consider using deeper beams or higher-strength materials to support longer spans safely. Placing columns at corners, stair cores, or near service zones such as bathrooms can help conceal structural elements within functional spaces. Maintaining symmetry and consistent spacing improves structural efficiency while preserving flexibility in furniture arrangement and future layout changes.
