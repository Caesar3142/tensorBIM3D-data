The thickness of a slab in a residential building depends mainly on the span between supports, the type of slab system, and the expected loads. There is no single universal thickness, but there are common practical ranges used in house construction.

For a typical reinforced concrete solid slab in a residential house with spans around 3 to 4 meters, a slab thickness of 100 mm to 125 mm is commonly used. For smaller spans closer to 3 meters, 100 mm may be sufficient. When spans approach 4 meters, 120 mm to 125 mm is more typical to control deflection and cracking.

If the span increases to around 4.5 to 5 meters, slab thickness may need to increase to 150 mm or more, depending on structural calculations. Thicker slabs reduce deflection and vibration but also increase self-weight, so the final dimension must balance structural performance and economy.

For two-storey residential buildings, the upper floor slab is usually in the 120 mm to 150 mm range if it is a conventional reinforced concrete slab supported by beams. If the slab is part of a flat slab system without beams, thickness is generally greater because it must resist punching shear around columns.

A common preliminary rule of thumb for reinforced concrete slabs is that slab thickness can be estimated as span divided by 25 to 30 for simply supported slabs, and span divided by 30 to 35 for continuous slabs. For example, for a 3.6 meter span, dividing by 30 gives about 120 mm, which aligns with common practice. However, this is only an initial estimate and must be verified with proper structural design.

For ground floor slabs on grade, thickness is often 100 mm to 125 mm, depending on soil condition and loading. If the slab supports heavier loads or poor soil conditions, it may be increased to 150 mm and reinforced appropriately.

In summary, for most residential reinforced concrete slabs with typical spans of 3 to 4 meters, a thickness between 100 mm and 125 mm is common, increasing to 150 mm for longer spans. Final slab thickness should always be determined by structural analysis according to local building codes and engineering standards.
