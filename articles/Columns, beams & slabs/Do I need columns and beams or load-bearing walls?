Whether you need columns and beams or load-bearing walls depends on how you want the house to function, how flexible the layout needs to be, and how complex the building form is. For a two-storey house, both systems are structurally valid, safe, and widely used. The decision is less about strength and more about layout freedom, construction practicality, and future adaptability.

Load-bearing walls work best when the house layout is compact, regular, and unlikely to change in the future. In this system, walls carry the weight of the floors and roof directly down to the foundation. It is very efficient for small houses with short spans and repetitive room layouts. Construction is usually simpler and sometimes cheaper because there are fewer structural elements, and builders in many regions are very familiar with this approach. However, load-bearing walls limit flexibility. Walls cannot be removed or shifted easily later, and large open spaces are harder to achieve without introducing additional beams or thick walls.

Columns and beams, usually in reinforced concrete or steel, are more suitable when you want an open-plan layout, larger living spaces, or flexibility over time. In this system, columns carry the vertical loads while beams and slabs span between them, allowing internal walls to be non-structural. This makes it much easier to combine living and dining spaces, relocate partitions, or modify the layout in the future. For houses with a small footprint but a desire for openness, this system is often more comfortable for daily living even if the initial construction cost is slightly higher.

Given your context so far, a small footprint, a two-storey house, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, combined living and dining, and good natural light, a column-and-beam system is generally the safer and more flexible choice. It allows you to keep the ground floor open and adaptable while placing bedrooms efficiently upstairs without being constrained by wall alignment everywhere. It also simplifies placing stairs, light wells, and larger openings for ventilation.

That said, a hybrid approach is very common and often ideal. External perimeter walls and some internal walls can be load-bearing, while key areas such as the living–dining space use columns and beams to create openness. This balances cost efficiency with spatial flexibility and works very well for small urban houses.

In summary, you do not strictly need columns and beams if your layout is very simple and fixed, but if you value open spaces, future flexibility, and easier layout planning, columns and beams are the better choice. For most modern two-storey family houses with compact footprints, a column-and-beam structure, possibly combined with some load-bearing walls, provides the best balance between comfort, flexibility, and buildability.
