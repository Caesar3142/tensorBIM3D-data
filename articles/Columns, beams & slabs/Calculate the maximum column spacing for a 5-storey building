To calculate the maximum column spacing for a 5-storey building, it is important to understand that column spacing is not a single fixed number but the result of several interacting assumptions. The span you can achieve depends on the structural system, material, floor system, loading, and serviceability limits such as deflection and vibration. Without detailed structural data, the calculation is done at a preliminary design level using standard engineering practice rather than exact member sizing.

First, we assume a typical 5-storey building with a normal floor-to-floor height of about 3 to 3.6 m, used for residential or office purposes. A common live load range is 2 to 3 kN/m² for residential use and 3 to 5 kN/m² for office use, with additional dead load from slabs, finishes, and partitions typically around 4 to 6 kN/m². These values already indicate that floor systems, not columns alone, usually govern the maximum spacing.

For a conventional reinforced concrete frame with beams and slabs, the governing element for column spacing is usually the beam span. As a rule of thumb, reinforced concrete beams become inefficient beyond about 7 to 8 m because beam depth increases significantly to control deflection. Using standard span-to-depth ratios, a practical maximum column spacing for an economical reinforced concrete frame is about 6 to 8 m. In this range, beam sizes remain reasonable, slab thickness stays manageable, and column sizes do not grow excessively as loads accumulate down the building.

If a flat slab or flat plate system is used, the maximum column spacing is usually smaller due to punching shear and deflection limits. For a 5-storey building, flat slabs typically work best with column spacing in the range of 6 to 7 m. Pushing beyond this often requires drop panels, column capitals, or post-tensioning, which increase complexity and cost. Without post-tensioning, exceeding about 7 m is generally inefficient for flat slab construction.

If post-tensioned concrete slabs are used, the maximum column spacing can increase significantly. Post-tensioning actively controls deflection and cracking, allowing spans of 8 to 10 m to be achieved efficiently even in multi-storey buildings. For a 5-storey structure, 8 to 9 m is commonly adopted as a practical upper limit for post-tensioned slabs before slab thickness, tendon quantity, and construction cost become less economical.

For steel or composite steel–concrete systems, longer spans are possible because steel beams are much lighter and stronger in bending. In such systems, column spacing of 8 to 12 m is realistic for a 5-storey building, especially for office use where open-plan layouts are desirable. Composite beams with concrete slabs further improve stiffness and vibration performance, making these spans practical without excessive beam depth.

Columns themselves rarely control spacing at this height; instead, they grow in size as spacing increases because each column supports a larger tributary area. In a 5-storey building with 8 m spacing, a single interior column supports roughly 64 m² per floor, or 320 m² total, multiplied by combined dead and live loads. This load level is still well within the capacity of typical reinforced concrete or steel columns with reasonable cross-sectional dimensions. Problems arise mainly from floor system efficiency, not axial column capacity.

In summary, for a 5-storey building, a realistic maximum column spacing is about 6–7 m for flat slabs, 6–8 m for conventional reinforced concrete beam–slab systems, 8–10 m for post-tensioned concrete slabs, and up to 10–12 m for steel or composite systems. The final spacing should always be selected based on the most economical balance between floor thickness, beam depth, column size, construction method, and the functional need for open space rather than pushing to the absolute structural limit.
