An open-plan hall requires a span system that can cover large areas without internal columns, allowing maximum flexibility of use and unobstructed sightlines. The best span system depends on the required span length, functional requirements, construction budget, available materials, and local expertise, but in general the most effective systems are those specifically designed for long-span performance and efficient load transfer.

For small to medium spans, typically up to around 20 to 25 meters, steel or reinforced concrete portal frames are among the most efficient solutions. Portal frames use rigid beam-column connections to resist bending moments, allowing the structure to span large distances with relatively shallow structural depth. They are widely used for halls, auditoriums, gymnasiums, and multipurpose spaces because they are economical, quick to construct, and adaptable to different architectural forms. Steel portal frames are especially efficient due to their high strength-to-weight ratio and ease of prefabrication.

For medium to large spans, roughly in the range of 25 to 40 meters, steel truss systems are often the most practical and cost-effective option. Trusses achieve long spans by converting bending forces into axial forces in their members, which significantly reduces material usage compared to solid beams. Roof trusses can be configured in many forms, such as Pratt, Howe, or Warren trusses, depending on span and loading conditions. They also provide space within the truss depth for mechanical, electrical, and lighting systems, which is particularly advantageous in open halls.

When spans become larger, typically beyond 40 meters, space frame systems become highly efficient. A space frame is a three-dimensional truss system that distributes loads in multiple directions, resulting in excellent stiffness and redundancy. This makes it ideal for large exhibition halls, convention centers, and sports arenas where wide, column-free spaces are essential. Although space frames can be more expensive initially, their structural efficiency and ability to cover very large areas with minimal depth often justify the cost for large open-plan halls.

For projects that emphasize architectural expression and sustainability, long-span timber systems such as glulam beams or arches can be an excellent choice. Glued laminated timber allows for long, curved, or straight members with high structural capacity and a warm interior aesthetic. Glulam arches and beams are commonly used in community halls, sports halls, and cultural buildings. While timber systems may require careful detailing for fire resistance and moisture control, they offer competitive performance for medium to large spans and can be cost-effective where timber is locally available.

In reinforced concrete construction, long-span systems such as post-tensioned slabs or deep concrete beams can also be used for open-plan halls, particularly when fire resistance, acoustic mass, or durability are priorities. Post-tensioning allows thinner slabs and longer spans by actively controlling deflection and cracking. However, concrete long-span systems are generally heavier than steel or timber alternatives, which can increase foundation costs and construction time.

Ultimately, the best span system for an open-plan hall is one that achieves the required clear span with minimum material, minimal construction complexity, and acceptable deflection and vibration performance. Steel trusses and portal frames are often the most economical and versatile for many halls, while space frames, glulam systems, or post-tensioned concrete become preferable as spans increase or when architectural, acoustic, or sustainability goals play a stronger role in the design.
