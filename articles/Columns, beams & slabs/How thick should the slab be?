The thickness of a slab in a typical house depends mainly on the span between supports, the structural system you use, and whether the slab is designed as a one-way or two-way system. For a two-storey residential house with normal loads, slab thickness is usually modest, and there are well-established rules of thumb that work reliably in practice.

For most houses using a conventional reinforced concrete beam-and-slab system, a slab thickness of about 120 to 150 mm is very common. If the spans between beams or walls are around 3 to 4 meters, a 120 mm slab is often sufficient. This thickness can safely carry residential loads while keeping deflection and cracking under control, provided proper reinforcement is designed and placed correctly.

If the slab spans are slightly larger, around 4 to 5 meters, increasing the slab thickness to about 130 to 150 mm is typical. This added thickness improves stiffness and vibration performance, which is important for comfort, especially on upper floors. In living areas where people walk, sit, and move frequently, slabs that are too thin can feel “bouncy,” even if they are technically strong enough.

For flat slab systems, where the slab rests directly on columns without beams, thickness usually needs to be greater. In small residential buildings, flat slabs are often around 180 to 200 mm thick, sometimes with drop panels around columns to control punching shear. Because of this increased thickness and higher cost, flat slabs are less common in houses unless there is a strong architectural reason for beam-free ceilings.

If post-tensioned slabs are used, thickness can be reduced while still achieving longer spans. In that case, slab thicknesses of around 150 to 180 mm can span 6 to 8 meters comfortably. However, post-tensioning is rarely used for small houses unless column reduction or long spans are a priority, as it requires specialized design and construction.

For ground floor slabs on grade, thickness is usually around 100 to 120 mm, since the slab is supported directly by the ground rather than spanning between beams or columns. This slab mainly acts as a wearing surface rather than a structural spanning element, although proper sub-base preparation and reinforcement are still essential.

In summary, for a typical two-storey house with normal room sizes and beam-supported slabs, a slab thickness of about 120 mm is usually adequate, increasing to 130–150 mm for larger spans or upper floors. The final thickness should always be confirmed by a structural engineer, but staying within this range ensures good structural performance, comfort, and cost efficiency for residential buildings.
