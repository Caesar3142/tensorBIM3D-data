A 20 m² living room, for example around 4 m × 5 m, is a comfortable medium-sized space that allows flexible furniture arrangements. The key is to define a clear focal point, maintain circulation paths of at least 80–90 cm, and avoid overcrowding.

One effective layout is to center the room around a main focal wall, usually the TV wall or a large window. Place a 3-seater sofa about 2 to 2.2 meters long along the longer wall, facing the focal point. Opposite the sofa, mount the TV on the wall or use a slim media console no deeper than 40 cm to maintain floor space. Keep at least 2.5 to 3 meters viewing distance between sofa and TV for comfort.

If the room is 4 m × 5 m, position the sofa along the 4-meter wall, leaving open space behind or to one side for circulation. Add one or two accent chairs positioned at an angle to create a conversational grouping rather than lining everything against the walls. A small coffee table about 60–80 cm wide can sit in the center, leaving at least 40–45 cm clearance between the sofa and table.

If you prefer an L-shaped sectional sofa, place it in a corner with the longer side against the wall and the shorter side extending inward. This works well if the room has an open-plan connection to dining or kitchen space. Ensure that the extended side does not block circulation to other areas.

For a more formal layout, create a symmetrical arrangement. Place a sofa centered on one wall and two armchairs opposite or angled inward. Add a rectangular rug about 1.6 m × 2.3 m to anchor the seating area. Ideally, the front legs of all seating pieces should rest on the rug to visually unify the layout.

If the living room includes a window on one side, avoid blocking it with tall furniture. Keep lower-profile seating near windows to preserve natural light. Storage units or bookshelves can be placed on solid walls where they do not interfere with pathways.

Lighting should be layered. A ceiling light provides general illumination, while a floor lamp near a seating corner and a table lamp on a side table create depth and warmth. Avoid placing all lighting in one central point.

In terms of spacing, maintain at least 80–90 cm wide walkways between main circulation routes, such as from entrance to hallway or dining area. This ensures the room feels open and easy to move through.

In summary, for a 20 m² living room, use one main sofa facing the focal wall, complement it with one or two accent chairs, anchor the space with a rug, keep circulation clear, and avoid oversized furniture. A balanced arrangement centered around a focal point will make the room feel organized, spacious, and comfortable.
