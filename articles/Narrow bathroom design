## Narrow bathroom design ##

Narrow bathroom design focuses on optimizing a long, limited-width space while maintaining functionality and comfort. Fixtures are typically arranged linearly along one or both walls to maximize circulation, with the toilet and sink often on one side and the shower or bathtub at the far end or opposite wall. Compact or wall-mounted fixtures, such as slim vanities and corner sinks, help save floor space. Using clear glass partitions for showers maintains an open feel, while light-colored tiles, mirrors, and vertical storage can visually expand the space. Adequate clearance—at least 21–24 inches (53–61 cm) in front of fixtures—and efficient wet-dry zoning are essential for usability and safety.
