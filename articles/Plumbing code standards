## Plumbing code standards ##

Plumbing code standards in bathrooms regulate the design, installation, and maintenance of water supply, drainage, and venting systems to ensure safety, hygiene, and functionality. Codes specify minimum pipe sizes for water supply and waste lines, proper slope for drainage pipes to prevent clogs, venting requirements to allow air circulation and prevent trap siphoning, and spacing and clearance around fixtures. They also cover fixture installation heights, backflow prevention, water heater connections, and use of approved materials. Adherence to plumbing codes ensures reliable water delivery, efficient drainage, prevention of leaks and contamination, and compliance with legal and safety requirements for residential and commercial bathrooms.
