In the United States, houses come in many types that reflect differences in lifestyle, density, climate, history, and economics. Below are the most common types of houses found across the country, explained in plain text.

Single-family detached house
This is the most common type of house in the US. It is a standalone building on its own lot, not sharing walls with other houses. It usually includes a front yard, backyard, and often an attached or detached garage. Single-family houses are common in suburban and rural areas and are designed for privacy, space, and family living.

Single-family attached house
These are houses that share one or more walls with neighboring houses but are still considered single-family units. Examples include duplexes or townhouses. Each unit typically has its own entrance and may have a small yard or garage.

Townhouse (row house)
A townhouse is a multi-level house that shares side walls with adjacent units in a row. Townhouses are common in urban and suburban areas where land is more limited. They usually have narrow widths, multiple floors, and efficient layouts. Ownership is often individual, similar to single-family homes.

Duplex, triplex, and fourplex
These are small multi-unit residential buildings with two, three, or four separate housing units. Units may be side-by-side or stacked vertically. They are common in cities and are often used for rental housing or owner-occupied investment properties.

Apartment building
Apartments consist of multiple housing units within one building, usually rented rather than owned. Apartment buildings range from small low-rise structures to large high-rise towers. They are common in urban areas and provide higher-density housing.

Condominium (condo)
A condominium refers to a type of ownership rather than a building form. Condos can be apartments, townhouses, or detached houses, but individual units are owned while common areas are shared and managed by a homeowners association. Condos are common in cities and resort areas.

Manufactured home (mobile home)
Manufactured homes are built in factories and transported to a site for installation. They are often placed in manufactured home communities or on private land. These homes are typically more affordable and are built to federal standards rather than local building codes.

Modular home
Modular homes are also factory-built but are constructed in sections (modules) and assembled on-site. Unlike manufactured homes, modular homes must meet local building codes and are often indistinguishable from site-built houses once completed.

Ranch house
The ranch house is a popular architectural style rather than a housing category. It is typically a single-story, long, low-profile house with an open layout and attached garage. Ranch houses are common in suburban areas and were especially popular in the mid-20th century.

Split-level house
A split-level house has floors that are staggered at different heights, connected by short staircases. This design separates living, sleeping, and service areas while maintaining a compact footprint. Split-level homes were popular in suburban developments.

Bungalow
A bungalow is usually a small to medium-sized, one- or one-and-a-half-story house with a simple layout and front porch. Bungalows are common in older neighborhoods and are valued for their charm and efficient use of space.

Cottage
Cottages are small houses that emphasize coziness and simplicity. In the US, the term is often used for vacation homes near lakes, beaches, or rural areas, though it can also describe small primary residences.

Victorian house
Victorian houses are older, often ornate homes built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They are characterized by decorative details, steep roofs, bay windows, and complex shapes. Many are now preserved as historic homes.

Contemporary and modern houses
These houses focus on modern design principles such as open plans, large windows, minimal ornamentation, and strong indoor-outdoor connections. They can be single-family or multi-unit and are increasingly common in new developments.

Tiny house
Tiny houses are very small dwellings designed to minimize space and cost. They may be built on permanent foundations or on trailers. While not mainstream, they represent a growing niche focused on simplicity and reduced living expenses.

In summary, housing in the US ranges from large detached suburban homes to compact urban apartments and specialized forms like manufactured or tiny houses. This diversity reflects differences in geography, culture, income, and personal lifestyle preferences across the country.
