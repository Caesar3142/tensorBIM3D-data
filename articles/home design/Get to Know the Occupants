Whether you are a design professional or a DIY/home enthusiast, the first step in the design process is learning about the people who will be occupying the space. Having a comprehensive list of questions is a good place to start. Why do you want to build or remodel? What are your goals and expectations for the new space? How many occupants will be living in the home? Do you entertain or have overnight guests frequently? Are there requirements for accessibility or aging in place? Can you describe your taste in the style and layout of the home? Will this be your primary residence? Answers to these types of questions should function as a guide to addressing many of the design principles that follow.
