## Smart toilet systems ##

Smart toilet systems integrate advanced technology to enhance comfort, hygiene, and convenience in the bathroom. Features often include automatic flushing, heated seats, built-in bidet functions with adjustable water temperature and pressure, air dryers, deodorizers, and night lights. Some systems offer touchless operation, remote controls, or app connectivity for personalized settings. Installation requires access to electrical power in addition to standard water and waste connections, and units are usually placed like conventional toilets, with sufficient clearance for use and maintenance. Smart toilets improve user experience, promote hygiene, and often include water-saving functions, but they require careful planning for plumbing, electrical supply, and proper ventilation.
