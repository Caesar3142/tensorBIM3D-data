## Minimize electricity cost in house design ##

To minimize electricity costs through house design, focus first on reducing energy demand using passive strategies such as proper orientation, deep roof overhangs, and shading to limit heat gain and lower cooling loads. Maximize cross-ventilation and stack ventilation so the house stays comfortable without heavy reliance on air conditioning. Use abundant natural daylight through well-placed windows, clerestories, or skylights to reduce daytime lighting use. Invest in good roof insulation and light-colored reflective roofing, as the roof is a major source of heat transfer. Choose energy-efficient appliances, LED lighting, and smart controls that automatically turn off unused systems. Zoning electrical circuits allows selective usage rather than powering the entire house. If the budget allows, add rooftop solar panels to offset consumption. By combining passive cooling, daylight optimization, insulation, and efficient equipment, you can significantly reduce long-term electricity expenses.
