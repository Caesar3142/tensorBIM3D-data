## Silicone sealing at corners ##

Silicone sealing at corners in a bathroom involves applying a flexible silicone caulk where walls meet walls, floors, or fixtures to prevent water from seeping into joints and causing damage. It is commonly used in wet zones such as showers, bathtub surrounds, and around sinks. The silicone creates a continuous, waterproof barrier that accommodates small movements or shifts in the building structure, preventing cracks that could allow leaks. Proper surface preparation—clean, dry, and free of dust or old sealant—is essential for adhesion, and smoothing the bead ensures a neat finish and effective water resistance. Regular inspection and replacement over time help maintain the seal’s effectiveness.
