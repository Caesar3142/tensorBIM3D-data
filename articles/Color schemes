## Color schemes ##

Color schemes in bathrooms help create a desired mood, sense of space, and aesthetic harmony. Light colors such as whites, creams, and pastels can make small bathrooms feel larger and brighter, while darker tones like grays, navy, or charcoal add a sense of sophistication and intimacy. Contrasting colors can be used to highlight features like vanities, tiles, or accent walls, and monochromatic schemes provide a clean, cohesive look. Natural colors from stone, wood, or earthy tones can evoke warmth, while vibrant accents bring energy and personality. Choosing a color scheme also considers lighting, fixture finishes, and overall design style to ensure a balanced and appealing bathroom environment.
