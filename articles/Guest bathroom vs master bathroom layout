## Guest bathroom vs master bathroom layout ##

A guest bathroom is typically smaller and designed for occasional use, often including just a toilet, a sink, and a shower or a small bathtub. Its layout focuses on efficiency and easy access, usually positioned near common areas like living or dining rooms. In contrast, a master bathroom is larger, often attached to the master bedroom, and designed for daily use by homeowners. It usually includes more features such as a bathtub, a separate shower, double sinks or vanities, ample storage, and sometimes a private toilet area. The layout of a master bathroom prioritizes comfort and luxury, with space for movement, larger countertops, and additional amenities like seating, mirrors, or dressing areas, whereas a guest bathroom maximizes functionality in a compact space.
