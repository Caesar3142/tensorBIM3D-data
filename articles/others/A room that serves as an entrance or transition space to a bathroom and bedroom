A room that serves as an entrance or transition space to a bathroom and bedroom is commonly called a dressing area, ante-room, or vestibule, depending on its function. If it mainly connects a bedroom to a bathroom, it’s often referred to as a dressing room or walk-through closet. In hotel-style layouts, it may also be called a vanity area or bath lobby.
