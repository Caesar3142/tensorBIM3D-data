For a comfortable residential staircase, the typical **riser height** is about **170–180 mm (6.5–7 inches)**, and the typical **going (tread depth)** is about **250–280 mm (10–11 inches)**. A common comfort rule is: 2 × riser + going ≈ 600–630 mm, which matches natural walking stride and helps ensure safe, ergonomic stairs.
