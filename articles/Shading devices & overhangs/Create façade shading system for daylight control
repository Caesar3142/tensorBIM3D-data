## Create façade shading system for daylight control ##

To create a façade shading system for daylight control, combine fixed and adjustable elements that filter sunlight before it enters the interior. Use horizontal overhangs or light shelves on north and south façades to block high-angle midday sun while allowing softer, reflected light deeper into the space. On east and west façades, install vertical fins or operable louvers to reduce low-angle morning and afternoon glare. Incorporating perforated metal screens, timber slats, or double-skin façades can diffuse light while maintaining ventilation and outward views. Adjustable systems provide flexibility to respond to seasonal sun changes and occupant comfort needs. Pair shading devices with high-performance glazing to further control solar heat gain. By layering shading elements externally rather than relying solely on interior blinds, you can achieve balanced daylight, minimize glare, and maintain energy efficiency.
