A west-facing lot receives strong afternoon sun, which is usually the hottest and most difficult to control. To reduce heat, the strategy is to block low-angle western sunlight before it enters the house, minimize heat absorption, and promote ventilation.

First, limit large west-facing windows. If possible, place service areas such as bathrooms, staircases, storage rooms, or garages along the west side. These spaces act as thermal buffers, protecting main living areas from direct sun. Keep major living rooms and bedrooms oriented toward the north, south, or east where sunlight is easier to manage.

Second, use strong vertical shading on the west façade. Because afternoon sun comes in at a low angle, horizontal overhangs alone are not enough. Install vertical fins, adjustable louvers, perforated metal screens, or deep recessed windows. A veranda or covered terrace on the west side also helps block direct sunlight from reaching walls and windows.

Third, add landscaping as a natural shield. Plant tall trees or dense shrubs along the western boundary to filter sunlight before it hits the house. Deciduous trees are ideal in climates with seasonal variation, while evergreen trees provide consistent shade in tropical regions. Avoid large paved areas on the west side, as concrete and asphalt absorb heat and radiate it back into the building.

Fourth, improve wall and roof insulation. West-facing walls receive intense heat, so adding insulation or using cavity wall construction reduces heat transfer indoors. Light-colored exterior finishes reflect more solar radiation than dark colors. For the roof, use reflective roofing materials and proper insulation to prevent accumulated heat from radiating downward.

Fifth, design for cross ventilation. Place operable windows on the east or opposite side of the house to allow cooler air to enter. If windows must exist on the west façade, use smaller openings combined with shading devices. Encourage diagonal airflow across rooms to remove heat buildup in the late afternoon and evening.

Sixth, use high-performance glazing on west windows. Low-emissivity glass or tinted glazing reduces solar heat gain while still allowing daylight. However, shading should remain the primary solution because stopping heat outside is more effective than blocking it after it enters.

Seventh, consider deeper setbacks or double-skin façades. A ventilated façade with an outer screen layer allows hot air to rise and escape before reaching the inner wall.

In summary, for a west-facing house, reduce window size on the west side, create buffer spaces, use vertical shading devices, plant trees, insulate walls and roof, and promote cross ventilation. The most effective strategy is blocking direct afternoon sun before it penetrates the building envelope.
