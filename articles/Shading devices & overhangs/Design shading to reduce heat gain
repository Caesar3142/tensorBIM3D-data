To reduce heat gain effectively, shading should block direct sunlight before it reaches windows and walls. The most effective shading happens outside the building envelope, because once sunlight passes through glass, it turns into heat that is harder to remove.

Start with roof overhangs. Horizontal overhangs above windows are very effective for south- or north-facing façades in many climates because they block high-angle midday sun while still allowing daylight. The depth of the overhang should be proportional to the window height. A simple guideline is that the projection depth can be about 30 to 50 percent of the window height. For example, for a 1.5 meter tall window, an overhang of 0.6 to 0.75 meters provides meaningful shading during peak sun hours.

For east- and west-facing windows, vertical shading works better because the sun is lower in the sky in the morning and afternoon. Use vertical fins, side screens, or adjustable louvers. West-facing walls usually receive the strongest afternoon heat, so minimizing window size on this side or adding deep vertical shading elements can significantly reduce indoor temperature rise.

Pergolas and extended canopies over terraces also help reduce heat gain, especially if they shade sliding glass doors. Adding climbing plants on pergolas provides additional cooling through evapotranspiration. This combination of structural and vegetative shading can noticeably reduce indoor heat.

External shading devices such as adjustable louvers or brise-soleil systems allow flexibility. They can be angled to block direct sunlight while still allowing airflow and indirect daylight. These are particularly effective in warm climates where ventilation is also important.

Wall shading is also important. Light-colored exterior finishes reflect more solar radiation than dark colors. Adding insulation behind walls reduces heat transfer. If possible, create a ventilated façade or cavity wall system that allows air to circulate and remove heat before it reaches the interior surface.

Landscaping plays a strong passive role. Planting deciduous trees on the west side provides shade during hot seasons while allowing sunlight through in cooler months. Shrubs placed near sun-exposed walls reduce reflected heat and create a cooler microclimate around the house.

Finally, combine shading with proper window glazing. Low-emissivity glass or reflective films reduce solar heat gain while maintaining visibility. However, external shading is still more effective than relying on glass performance alone.

In summary, design shading with horizontal overhangs for high sun angles, vertical elements for low-angle sun, extended rooflines, ventilated façades, light exterior colors, and strategic landscaping. Blocking sunlight before it enters the house is the most efficient way to reduce heat gain and lower cooling demand.
