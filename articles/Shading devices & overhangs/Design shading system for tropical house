## Design shading system for tropical house ##

A shading system for a tropical house should combine deep roof overhangs, vertical and horizontal sun-control elements, and natural landscaping to block intense solar radiation while maintaining airflow. Wide eaves extending at least 80–120 cm can protect walls and windows from direct sun and heavy rain. Horizontal shading devices such as canopies and balconies are effective on north and south façades, while vertical fins or adjustable louvers work better on east and west sides where the sun is lower. Incorporating operable timber or aluminum screens allows flexibility to control glare and privacy without restricting ventilation. Pergolas with climbing plants can shade terraces and outdoor spaces while cooling the air naturally. Light-colored exterior finishes and reflective roofing further reduce heat absorption. The overall goal is to create layered shading that protects the building envelope, reduces indoor heat gain, and still allows generous natural light and cross-ventilation.
