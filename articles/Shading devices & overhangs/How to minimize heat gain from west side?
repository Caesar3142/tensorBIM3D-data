## How to minimize heat gain from west side? ##

To minimize heat gain from the west side, reduce large window openings on that façade since afternoon sun is the most intense and difficult to shade. Use vertical shading devices such as fins, deep overhangs, or adjustable louvers to block low-angle sunlight, and consider installing external screens or double-skin façades to filter heat before it reaches the glass. Planting tall trees or dense vegetation on the west side can provide natural shading and cool incoming air. Use high-performance glazing with low solar heat gain coefficient (low-SHGC) and insulated walls with reflective or light-colored exterior finishes to reduce heat absorption. If possible, place service areas like bathrooms, staircases, storage, or garages along the west side to act as thermal buffers, protecting main living spaces from direct afternoon heat.
