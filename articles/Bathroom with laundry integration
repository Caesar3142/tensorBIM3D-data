## Bathroom with laundry integration ##

A bathroom with laundry integration combines typical bathroom fixtures—such as a toilet, sink, and shower or bathtub—with laundry appliances like a washer and dryer. Planning focuses on efficient use of space while separating wet and dry zones to prevent water from affecting laundry areas. Stackable or compact machines are often used, and countertops or cabinets can provide folding space and storage. Proper plumbing and drainage must accommodate both bathroom fixtures and appliances, and ventilation is critical to manage moisture from both showers and washing machines. Clearances around fixtures and machines—at least 24 inches (61 cm) in front and adequate side space—ensure usability, while durable, water-resistant flooring and materials maintain safety and longevity in the combined space.
