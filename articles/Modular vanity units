## Modular vanity units ##

Modular vanity units are pre-manufactured, configurable bathroom storage and sink units that can be customized to fit different layouts and sizes. They often consist of separate components, such as drawers, cabinets, countertops, and sinks, which can be combined or stacked according to space and storage needs. Modular vanities allow for easier installation, future upgrades, or replacement of individual parts without major renovations. Materials can range from laminated wood and MDF to stone or acrylic countertops, balancing durability and cost. These units are popular for their flexibility, efficient use of space, and ability to maintain a clean, organized, and modern bathroom appearance.
