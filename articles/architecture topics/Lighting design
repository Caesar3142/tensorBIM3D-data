Lighting design in architecture involves planning and integrating light to support function, comfort, and atmosphere within a space. It considers both natural and artificial lighting to ensure spaces are usable, visually comfortable, and expressive throughout different times of day.

Effective lighting design responds to the activities taking place in each area. Task lighting supports specific functions, ambient lighting provides overall illumination, and accent lighting highlights architectural features or focal points. The balance between these layers helps create clarity and visual interest without glare or excessive contrast.

Lighting design also influences mood and perception. Light intensity, color temperature, and direction affect how spaces feel, making them appear warm, calm, energetic, or formal. Careful placement of fixtures and control systems allows lighting to adapt to different uses and user preferences.

By integrating lighting design early in the architectural process, buildings achieve better performance and experience. Thoughtful lighting enhances safety, energy efficiency, and spatial quality, reinforcing the overall design intent of the interior environment.
