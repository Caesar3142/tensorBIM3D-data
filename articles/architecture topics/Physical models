Physical models in architecture are tangible, three-dimensional representations of a building or space, created to explore, communicate, and test design ideas. They allow architects, clients, and stakeholders to see and experience the form, scale, and spatial relationships in a way that drawings or digital models alone may not convey.

Models can vary in scale, detail, and material, from simple massing studies using cardboard or foam to highly detailed replicas with finishes, textures, and miniature furnishings. They are often used in the early design phase to study proportions, circulation, and overall composition, as well as later for presentations or approvals.

Physical models also support iterative design and problem-solving. They help identify potential design conflicts, test structural concepts, and experiment with light, shadow, and materiality. Because they are tactile and three-dimensional, models enhance understanding and engagement for all participants in the design process.

By using physical models, architects can complement drawings and digital visualizations, providing a more intuitive and interactive way to communicate ideas, refine designs, and explore spatial experiences before construction.
