Thermal comfort in architecture refers to the condition in which occupants feel neither too hot nor too cold within a space. It is a key aspect of building performance, directly affecting health, productivity, and overall well-being.

Achieving thermal comfort involves balancing air temperature, humidity, air movement, and radiant heat from surrounding surfaces. Architectural design influences these factors through building orientation, insulation, material selection, shading, and the use of natural ventilation. The design of the building envelope plays a major role in controlling heat gain and heat loss.

Thermal comfort also depends on user behavior and expectations. Different activities, clothing levels, and cultural contexts affect how people perceive temperature. Providing opportunities for occupant control, such as operable windows or adjustable shading, helps accommodate varying comfort needs.

By addressing thermal comfort as part of an integrated design strategy, architecture can reduce reliance on mechanical heating and cooling systems. This results in more energy-efficient buildings that provide comfortable, healthy environments throughout the year.
