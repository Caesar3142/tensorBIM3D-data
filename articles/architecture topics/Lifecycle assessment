Lifecycle assessment in architecture is the process of evaluating the environmental impact of a building or its components throughout their entire lifespan—from material extraction and production, through construction, use, maintenance, and eventual disposal or recycling. It helps designers understand the ecological footprint of a project and make more sustainable choices.

This assessment considers factors such as energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, water use, waste generation, and resource depletion at each stage of a building’s life. It also examines durability, maintenance needs, and potential for reuse or recycling, providing a holistic view of environmental performance.

By conducting a lifecycle assessment early in design, architects can compare materials, systems, and construction methods to minimize negative impacts. This approach informs decisions about energy-efficient systems, sustainable materials, and long-term operational strategies, ultimately supporting environmentally responsible architecture.

Lifecycle assessment ensures that sustainability is not limited to initial construction but is considered across the building’s full existence, promoting resilience, cost efficiency, and ecological stewardship.
