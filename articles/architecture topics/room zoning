Room zoning in architecture is the organization of spaces based on their level of access, function, and privacy. Dividing areas into public, private, and service zones helps create clear spatial order and supports both functional efficiency and user comfort.

Public zones are areas intended for shared use and visitor access. These typically include entrances, lobbies, reception areas, living spaces, or communal facilities. They are often positioned near primary access points and designed to be open, welcoming, and easy to navigate.

Private zones are reserved for activities that require privacy and limited access. Examples include bedrooms, offices, meeting rooms, or staff-only areas. These spaces are usually located deeper within the building or separated from public zones to reduce noise and disturbance, creating a sense of security and personal comfort.

Service zones support the operation of the building and are generally not meant for public use. They include kitchens, storage areas, mechanical rooms, toilets, and utility spaces. Effective room zoning places service areas strategically to ensure efficiency, ease of maintenance, and minimal interference with public and private activities. Together, these zones create a balanced and well-functioning spatial layout.
