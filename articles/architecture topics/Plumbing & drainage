Plumbing and drainage in architecture refer to the systems that provide water supply and remove wastewater from a building. These systems are essential for health, hygiene, and the overall functionality of both residential and commercial structures.

Plumbing includes the pipes, fixtures, and fittings that deliver clean water for drinking, cooking, bathing, and other uses. Drainage involves the collection and removal of wastewater, rainwater, and stormwater, ensuring safe disposal and preventing flooding or contamination.

Designing plumbing and drainage systems requires careful planning of pipe routes, gradients, venting, and connections to municipal networks or on-site treatment systems. Accessibility for maintenance, water efficiency, and integration with the building layout are also important considerations.

Effective plumbing and drainage design supports occupant comfort, safety, and sustainability. By ensuring reliable water supply and efficient waste removal, these systems contribute to the long-term performance and usability of a building.
