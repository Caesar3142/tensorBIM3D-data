Furniture layout in architecture and interior design refers to the arrangement of furniture within a space to support function, comfort, and movement. It plays a key role in how a room is used and experienced, influencing circulation, social interaction, and spatial efficiency.

A well-planned furniture layout considers the purpose of the space and the activities that take place within it. Furniture size, orientation, and spacing are arranged to allow clear movement paths while maintaining comfortable distances for seating, work, or gathering. This ensures the space feels neither overcrowded nor underutilized.

Furniture layout also helps define zones within a room, especially in open-plan spaces. Strategic placement can separate activities, create focal points, and reinforce spatial hierarchy without the need for permanent partitions. It also affects sightlines, access to natural light, and overall visual balance.

By aligning furniture layout with architectural intent, spaces become more functional and adaptable. Thoughtful arrangements enhance usability, improve comfort, and allow interiors to respond flexibly to changing needs over time.
