Floor plan design is the process of organizing spaces within a building on a horizontal plane to support function, movement, and comfort. It defines how rooms relate to one another, how people circulate, and how activities are accommodated within a given area. A well-designed floor plan forms the foundation of an efficient and usable building.

This design process considers room sizes, shapes, and adjacencies to ensure spaces support their intended functions. Factors such as privacy, noise control, daylight access, and views influence how rooms are positioned. The floor plan also integrates circulation elements like corridors, stairs, and entry points to create clear and logical movement throughout the building.

Floor plan design must balance functional requirements with spatial quality. Efficient layouts minimize wasted space while maintaining comfort and flexibility. Structural systems, building services, and regulatory requirements also play a role, influencing wall placement, spans, and service zones.

Ultimately, a successful floor plan enhances daily experience by making spaces intuitive and adaptable. It allows the building to function smoothly while supporting long-term use, changes in occupancy, and evolving needs over time.
