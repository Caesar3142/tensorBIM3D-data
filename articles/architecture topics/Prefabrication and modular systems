Prefabrication and modular systems in architecture involve manufacturing building components or entire units off-site and assembling them on-site. This approach shifts much of the construction process into controlled factory environments, improving efficiency, quality control, and predictability.

Prefabrication typically refers to individual components such as wall panels, floor slabs, structural elements, or service modules that are produced off-site and installed as part of a larger system. Modular construction goes further by creating complete volumetric units, often including finishes and services, that are transported and assembled on-site.

These systems offer advantages in speed of construction, reduced waste, and improved safety, as less work is required on-site. They also allow for consistent quality and can reduce disruptions in dense urban areas. Design coordination is critical, as dimensions, connections, and tolerances must be resolved early in the process.

By integrating prefabrication and modular systems into architectural design, projects can achieve greater efficiency and adaptability. When thoughtfully applied, these methods support sustainable construction practices while maintaining architectural quality and performance.
