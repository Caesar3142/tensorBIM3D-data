Energy efficiency in architecture refers to the design and operation of buildings in a way that minimizes energy consumption while maintaining comfort, functionality, and performance. It is a key component of sustainable design, aiming to reduce environmental impact and long-term operating costs.

Energy-efficient design begins with passive strategies such as proper building orientation, optimized massing, high-performance envelopes, effective insulation, and the use of natural lighting and ventilation. These strategies reduce the demand for artificial heating, cooling, and lighting before mechanical systems are considered.

Active systems also play an important role. Efficient HVAC systems, lighting controls, smart building technologies, and renewable energy sources such as solar panels help further reduce energy use. The integration of these systems must be carefully coordinated with architectural design to achieve optimal performance.

By prioritizing energy efficiency from the early design stages, buildings become more resilient and cost-effective over their lifecycle. Energy-efficient architecture supports environmental responsibility while providing comfortable, healthy spaces for occupants.
