Fire safety and evacuation in architecture focus on protecting occupants and property from fire hazards while ensuring safe and efficient escape during emergencies. This involves designing both preventive measures and clear egress routes that guide people to safety.

Fire safety strategies include active systems such as smoke detectors, fire alarms, sprinklers, and emergency lighting, which detect and respond to fires quickly. Passive measures, like fire-rated walls, doors, and compartmentalization, help contain flames and smoke, limiting their spread and protecting critical areas.

Evacuation planning addresses the layout of safe routes, staircases, ramps, and exits, ensuring they are visible, accessible, and unobstructed. Signage, lighting, and emergency communication systems support wayfinding during high-stress situations. Occupancy loads and evacuation times are carefully calculated to meet safety standards.

Integrating fire safety and evacuation measures early in design ensures that buildings comply with regulations, minimize risk, and protect lives. Thoughtful planning creates spaces that are resilient, safe, and easy to navigate under emergency conditions.
