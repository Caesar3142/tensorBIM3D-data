Space programming is the process of identifying, organizing, and defining the spaces required for a building based on its intended use. It translates functional needs into spatial requirements, providing a clear framework that guides the design from early planning through detailed development.

This process involves understanding who will use the building, what activities will take place, and how often each space will be used. Factors such as room sizes, occupancy, adjacencies, privacy levels, and operational relationships are carefully considered. Space programming helps ensure that all necessary functions are accommodated efficiently without unnecessary duplication or wasted area.

Space programming also establishes relationships between spaces. It determines which areas should be closely connected, which require separation, and how movement between them should occur. These relationships support workflow, safety, and user comfort, forming the basis for spatial hierarchy and circulation design.

By clearly defining requirements before formal design begins, space programming reduces uncertainty and design revisions later in the process. It helps align client needs, user experience, and design intent, resulting in buildings that function effectively while supporting long-term flexibility and adaptability.
