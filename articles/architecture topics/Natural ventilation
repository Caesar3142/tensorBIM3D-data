Natural ventilation in architecture refers to the use of passive design strategies to move fresh air through a building without relying primarily on mechanical systems. It improves indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy efficiency by harnessing natural forces such as wind and buoyancy.

This approach considers building orientation, layout, and the placement of openings to encourage airflow. Strategies like cross-ventilation allow air to flow between opposite openings, while stack ventilation uses differences in air temperature and height to drive upward air movement. Courtyards, atriums, and ventilation shafts often support these systems.

Natural ventilation must respond to local climate conditions. Designers balance airflow with protection from excessive heat, humidity, noise, or pollution. Adjustable openings and shading elements allow occupants to control ventilation based on comfort and seasonal changes.

By integrating natural ventilation early in the design process, buildings become more resilient and sustainable. This approach reduces energy consumption, enhances occupant comfort, and creates a stronger connection between interior spaces and the outdoor environment.
