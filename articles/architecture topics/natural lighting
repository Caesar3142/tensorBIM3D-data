Natural lighting, or daylighting, in architecture refers to the intentional use of natural light to illuminate interior spaces. It plays a vital role in enhancing visual comfort, supporting human well-being, and reducing dependence on artificial lighting.

Effective daylighting considers the placement, size, and orientation of windows, skylights, atriums, and light wells. These elements are designed to distribute light evenly, minimize glare, and avoid excessive heat gain. Surface reflectivity, ceiling height, and spatial depth also influence how daylight penetrates and spreads within a space.

Daylighting strategies respond to climate and building orientation. Shading devices, façade articulation, and glazing selection help control sunlight throughout the day and across seasons. When balanced correctly, daylight improves indoor comfort while maintaining energy efficiency.

By integrating natural lighting into the design process, architecture creates healthier and more pleasant environments. Daylighting enhances spatial quality, supports productivity and well-being, and contributes to sustainable building performance over the building’s lifecycle.
