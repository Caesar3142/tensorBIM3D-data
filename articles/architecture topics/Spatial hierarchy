Spatial hierarchy in architecture refers to the organization of spaces according to their level of importance, function, and use. It helps users understand how to move through a building and intuitively recognize which areas are primary, secondary, or private. A clear hierarchy makes spaces more legible and easier to navigate.

This hierarchy is established through differences in size, height, location, and visibility. Major spaces such as entrances, lobbies, or communal areas are often larger, more open, or more prominently positioned, while supporting spaces are more modest and discreet. Transitions between spaces also play a role, guiding movement from public to semi-public and private areas.

Spatial hierarchy also supports functional efficiency. By organizing spaces according to frequency of use and level of access, architects can improve circulation, reduce confusion, and enhance the overall user experience. Visual cues such as light, views, and material changes further reinforce the hierarchy without relying solely on signage.

Ultimately, spatial hierarchy gives structure and meaning to architectural space. It allows buildings to communicate their organization clearly, helping users feel oriented and comfortable while reinforcing the intended use and character of each space.
