Green materials in architecture are building materials selected for their low environmental impact, sustainability, and health benefits. These materials are chosen to reduce energy consumption, minimize waste, and promote safe, non-toxic indoor environments.

Green materials often include recycled, reclaimed, or rapidly renewable resources, such as bamboo, recycled steel, reclaimed wood, or low-VOC (volatile organic compound) paints and finishes. Locally sourced materials are also considered green because they reduce transportation-related carbon emissions and support regional economies.

Durability and lifecycle performance are key factors. Materials that last longer, require minimal maintenance, and can be reused or recycled at the end of their life contribute to sustainability. Green materials also consider the energy required for production, installation, and disposal, aiming to reduce the overall environmental footprint.

By incorporating green materials into design, architects create buildings that are healthier for occupants, environmentally responsible, and aligned with sustainable practices. These materials help reduce ecological impact while enhancing the aesthetic and functional quality of spaces.
