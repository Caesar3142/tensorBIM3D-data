Adjacency planning is the process of organizing spaces based on their functional relationships and proximity requirements. It focuses on which rooms or areas should be close to one another, which should be separated, and how they connect to support efficient use and smooth movement within a building.

This planning approach is driven by patterns of use and operational needs. Spaces that share frequent interaction or workflow are placed near each other to reduce travel time and improve efficiency, while areas that require privacy, quiet, or security are positioned away from high-traffic zones. Adjacency planning helps prevent functional conflicts and enhances overall usability.

Adjacency relationships also influence circulation and spatial hierarchy. Logical grouping of related spaces makes navigation more intuitive and supports clear transitions between public, semi-public, and private areas. Visual and physical connections between adjacent spaces can further reinforce their relationship.

By addressing spatial relationships early in the design process, adjacency planning provides a strong organizational framework. It helps translate functional requirements into a coherent layout, supporting both operational performance and a positive user experience.
