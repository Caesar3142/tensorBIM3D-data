Indoor air quality refers to the condition of the air within a building and how it affects the health, comfort, and well-being of occupants. Good indoor air quality is essential for creating healthy environments, as people spend a significant amount of time indoors.

Architectural design influences indoor air quality through ventilation strategies, material selection, and spatial planning. Adequate fresh air supply, whether through natural or mechanical ventilation, helps dilute pollutants and control humidity. Building layout can also support effective air movement and reduce the buildup of contaminants.

Materials and finishes play a critical role in air quality. Low-emission materials reduce the release of volatile organic compounds, while proper detailing prevents moisture accumulation that can lead to mold growth. Maintenance access and system design further support long-term air quality performance.

By addressing indoor air quality as an integral part of design, architecture promotes healthier and more comfortable spaces. Good air quality supports occupant health, productivity, and overall quality of life while contributing to sustainable building performance.
