Openings in architecture, including windows and doors, serve as critical connections between interior and exterior spaces. They allow light, air, movement, and visual interaction, directly influencing comfort, functionality, and the overall experience of a building.

Windows are primarily responsible for bringing in natural daylight and providing views. Their size, placement, and orientation affect lighting quality, ventilation, and thermal performance. Thoughtful window design balances openness with control, managing glare, heat gain, privacy, and noise while enhancing the connection to the surrounding environment.

Doors define entry, access, and transitions between spaces. They organize circulation, establish hierarchy, and influence how people move through a building. Door placement, scale, and detailing contribute to wayfinding and accessibility, ensuring spaces are easy to understand and use.

Together, windows and doors shape how a building breathes, functions, and communicates. Well-designed openings support environmental performance while reinforcing architectural character, making spaces feel connected, comfortable, and responsive to their context.
