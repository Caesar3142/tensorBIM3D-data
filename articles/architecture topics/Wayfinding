Wayfinding in architecture refers to how people understand and navigate a space without confusion or stress. It involves the use of spatial organization, visual cues, and environmental design to help users orient themselves, make decisions, and move confidently from one place to another.

Effective wayfinding begins with clear spatial planning. Logical layouts, visible circulation paths, and recognizable landmarks help users intuitively understand where they are and where they need to go. Changes in scale, light, or material can signal transitions between different zones or functions.

Graphic elements such as signage, symbols, and maps support wayfinding but work best when integrated with architectural design rather than used as the sole solution. Consistent color schemes, lighting cues, and sightlines reinforce orientation and reduce reliance on written instructions.

By prioritizing wayfinding, architecture becomes more accessible and user-friendly. Clear navigation enhances comfort and safety, improves overall experience, and allows buildings to function smoothly for both first-time visitors and regular users.
