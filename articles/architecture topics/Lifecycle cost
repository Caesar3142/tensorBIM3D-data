Lifecycle cost in architecture refers to the total cost of a building or its components over their entire lifespan, from initial design and construction through operation, maintenance, and eventual replacement or disposal. This approach goes beyond upfront construction costs to include long-term expenses, helping owners make more informed financial and design decisions.

Key factors in lifecycle cost analysis include energy consumption, water use, maintenance, repairs, replacement of materials or systems, and operational expenses. Durable materials, efficient systems, and sustainable design strategies can reduce lifecycle costs by minimizing ongoing maintenance and energy requirements.

Considering lifecycle cost during the design phase allows architects and engineers to balance initial investment with long-term performance and efficiency. It encourages decisions that optimize both economic and environmental outcomes.

By evaluating lifecycle costs, projects can achieve more sustainable, cost-effective, and resilient buildings that provide value over time while supporting high-quality performance and user comfort.
