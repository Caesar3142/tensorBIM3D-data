Façade design refers to the planning and articulation of a building’s exterior envelope. It is the most visible aspect of architecture and plays a crucial role in expressing the building’s identity, function, and relationship with its surroundings.

A façade is more than an aesthetic surface; it mediates between interior and exterior environments. Its design considers openings, shading, materials, and proportions to control daylight, heat gain, ventilation, and views. These elements directly affect indoor comfort and energy performance while shaping the building’s visual character.

Façade design also responds to context and scale. The rhythm of openings, material choices, and surface articulation help the building relate to neighboring structures, street life, and human perception. A well-designed façade can communicate transparency, solidity, openness, or privacy depending on the intended use and setting.

Through thoughtful integration of performance and expression, façade design connects technical requirements with architectural meaning. It allows the building to communicate its purpose clearly while contributing positively to the urban or natural environment.
