Land orientation and sun path analysis in architecture focuses on how a site is positioned relative to the sun and how sunlight moves across it throughout the day and year. This understanding is essential for creating buildings that are comfortable, energy-efficient, and responsive to their environment.

Land orientation considers the direction the site and building face, which directly affects solar exposure, daylight availability, and heat gain. Proper orientation can maximize natural lighting, reduce reliance on artificial lighting, and help control indoor temperatures. It also influences the placement of openings, shading devices, and outdoor spaces.

Sun path analysis examines the sun’s movement across the sky at different times of day and during different seasons. By studying this pattern, architects can predict areas of excessive heat, glare, or shadow. This information helps inform design strategies such as window sizing, façade articulation, roof forms, and landscape elements that provide shading or allow beneficial sunlight.

Together, land orientation and sun path analysis support sustainable design decisions. They help balance comfort and performance, ensuring buildings take advantage of natural light and heat when beneficial while minimizing negative impacts. This results in spaces that are healthier for occupants and more efficient over their lifecycle.
