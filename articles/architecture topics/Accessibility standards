Accessibility standards in architecture are regulations and guidelines that ensure buildings and spaces are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities or limited mobility. These standards promote inclusive design, allowing all occupants to access, navigate, and use facilities safely and independently.

Standards cover elements such as entrances, door widths, ramps, elevators, restrooms, circulation paths, signage, and controls. They specify minimum dimensions, slopes, clearances, and tactile or visual indicators to accommodate different physical, sensory, and cognitive needs.

Designing according to accessibility standards ensures that spaces are equitable and functional for a wide range of users. It also helps buildings comply with legal requirements, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States or similar codes worldwide.

By integrating accessibility standards into the design process, architects create environments that are safe, comfortable, and inclusive. Thoughtful application of these standards improves usability for everyone, not just people with disabilities, enhancing overall user experience and social responsibility.
