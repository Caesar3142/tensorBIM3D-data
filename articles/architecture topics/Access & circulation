Access and circulation in architecture refer to how people, vehicles, and services enter, move through, and exit a site or building. This aspect of design is essential for functionality, safety, and user comfort, as it directly affects how easily and intuitively spaces can be used.

Access focuses on entry points and connections to the surrounding context, such as streets, sidewalks, public transport, and neighboring buildings. It considers who is entering the site and how, including pedestrians, vehicles, service staff, and emergency access. Clear and well-positioned access points help users understand where to go and reduce congestion or conflict between different types of movement.

Circulation addresses the internal movement within the site or building. It includes pathways, corridors, staircases, ramps, elevators, and open spaces that guide people from one area to another. Effective circulation design creates logical, efficient routes that support spatial hierarchy, wayfinding, and accessibility for all users.

Together, access and circulation shape the overall experience of a place. When thoughtfully designed, they make spaces feel intuitive, safe, and comfortable, supporting smooth movement while reinforcing the organization and purpose of the architectural environment.
