Building massing refers to the overall three-dimensional form and volume of a building as it is perceived in relation to its site and surroundings. It describes how the building’s bulk is shaped, organized, and articulated, and plays a major role in defining its visual impact and spatial presence.

Massing considers how different parts of a building are composed, such as whether volumes are compact or fragmented, stacked or spread out. These decisions affect how the building relates to human scale, neighboring structures, and open spaces. Effective massing can make large buildings feel approachable or give smaller buildings a stronger identity.

Building massing also influences environmental performance. The arrangement of volumes affects sunlight penetration, shading, wind flow, and views. Thoughtful massing can improve daylight access, reduce heat gain, and enhance natural ventilation while responding to site constraints and climate conditions.

By shaping how a building occupies space, massing becomes a key link between concept and physical reality. It helps translate functional requirements and design intent into a form that is coherent, responsive, and well integrated with its context.
