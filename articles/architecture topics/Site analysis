Site analysis is the process of studying and understanding the physical, environmental, and contextual conditions of a project location before design begins. It provides a factual and analytical foundation that informs design decisions, ensuring the proposed architecture responds appropriately to its surroundings rather than being based on assumptions.

This analysis typically includes factors such as topography, climate, sun path, wind patterns, soil conditions, vegetation, access points, and existing utilities. It also examines constraints like zoning regulations, setbacks, easements, and environmental limitations. Understanding these elements helps architects identify opportunities and challenges that will influence building placement, orientation, and form.

Beyond physical conditions, site analysis considers the broader context, including neighboring buildings, street networks, pedestrian movement, views, noise sources, and cultural or historical significance. These aspects help determine how the project should relate to its surroundings in terms of scale, access, and visual impact.

By synthesizing this information, site analysis becomes a critical tool for making informed design choices. It reduces risks, improves performance, and supports a design approach that is responsive, efficient, and well integrated with its environment.
