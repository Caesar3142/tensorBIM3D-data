Electrical and lighting systems in architecture refer to the infrastructure that provides power and illumination throughout a building. These systems are essential for functionality, safety, comfort, and the aesthetic experience of interior and exterior spaces.

Electrical systems include wiring, outlets, circuit breakers, panels, and power distribution that supply energy to lighting, appliances, HVAC systems, and other equipment. Proper design ensures safety, efficiency, and the ability to meet current and future electrical demands.

Lighting systems involve both artificial and integrated natural lighting. Artificial lighting is planned to provide adequate illumination for tasks, general ambiance, and accentuating architectural features. Lighting design considers fixture types, placement, intensity, color temperature, and control systems to enhance visual comfort and energy efficiency.

By coordinating electrical and lighting systems with architectural design, buildings achieve functional reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Thoughtful integration also enhances spatial quality, atmosphere, and user experience, making the building both practical and enjoyable to inhabit.
