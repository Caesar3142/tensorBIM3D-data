Building codes in architecture are a set of regulations and standards established by local, national, or international authorities to ensure the safety, health, accessibility, and sustainability of buildings. They provide mandatory guidelines for design, construction, and occupancy, helping protect occupants and the public.

These codes cover a wide range of areas, including structural integrity, fire safety, electrical and plumbing systems, accessibility, energy efficiency, and environmental performance. Compliance with building codes ensures that buildings can withstand natural forces, provide safe egress, and meet minimum performance standards.

Architects and engineers must consider building codes from the earliest design stages to avoid conflicts, costly revisions, and legal issues. Codes also influence spatial planning, materials selection, system integration, and site layout.

By adhering to building codes, projects achieve legal compliance, occupant safety, and overall quality. They provide a framework that balances innovation with proven standards, ensuring buildings are reliable, functional, and resilient over time.
