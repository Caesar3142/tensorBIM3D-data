Wind and ventilation analysis in architecture examines how air moves across a site and through a building. This analysis helps designers understand local wind patterns and use them to improve thermal comfort, indoor air quality, and overall building performance.

At the site level, wind analysis considers prevailing wind directions, seasonal variations, surrounding buildings, vegetation, and topography. These factors influence wind speed and turbulence around the site, affecting pedestrian comfort, outdoor usability, and potential heat or pollutant dispersion. Understanding these conditions helps guide building placement, orientation, and landscape design.

Within the building, ventilation analysis focuses on how fresh air enters, moves through, and exits interior spaces. It informs strategies for natural ventilation such as cross-ventilation, stack effect, and the placement of openings, atriums, and vents. Properly designed ventilation paths can reduce dependence on mechanical systems and enhance occupant comfort.

By integrating wind and ventilation analysis early in the design process, architects can create healthier and more energy-efficient buildings. This approach supports passive design strategies, improves indoor environmental quality, and ensures the building responds intelligently to its climatic context.
