HVAC concepts in architecture refer to the principles and systems used to control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning within buildings. These systems are essential for maintaining thermal comfort, indoor air quality, and energy efficiency, while supporting the functional requirements of different spaces.

Heating systems provide warmth during cold periods, using methods such as boilers, radiant floors, or heat pumps. Cooling systems remove excess heat through air conditioning, chilled beams, or evaporative cooling. Ventilation ensures a supply of fresh air, removes pollutants, and controls humidity, which is critical for health and comfort.

Modern HVAC design emphasizes integration with the building’s architecture and sustainability goals. Passive strategies, such as natural ventilation, shading, and thermal mass, can reduce HVAC load, while efficient mechanical systems and controls optimize energy use. Zoning, duct layout, and system capacity are carefully planned to match occupancy patterns and space requirements.

Understanding HVAC concepts allows architects and engineers to create comfortable, healthy, and energy-efficient buildings. Properly designed systems balance performance, cost, and environmental impact while enhancing overall user experience.
