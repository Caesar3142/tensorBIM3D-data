Interior layout in architecture refers to the organization and arrangement of spaces within a building to support function, comfort, and user experience. It defines how rooms are positioned, how they connect, and how people move and interact within the interior environment.

A well-designed interior layout responds to the building’s program and daily activities. It considers room sizes, adjacencies, privacy levels, and circulation paths to ensure spaces are practical and efficient. Clear zoning between public, private, and service areas helps reduce conflicts and improve usability.

Interior layout also influences environmental quality. Access to daylight, ventilation, views, and acoustics is shaped by how spaces are arranged. Structural elements and building services must be coordinated with the layout to maintain flexibility and avoid constraints on future use.

By carefully planning the interior layout, architecture creates spaces that feel intuitive and adaptable. A thoughtful layout enhances comfort, supports long-term functionality, and allows interiors to evolve with changing needs.
