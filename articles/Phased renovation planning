## Phased renovation planning ##

Phased renovation planning in a bathroom involves dividing the remodeling process into stages to manage costs, minimize disruption, and ensure quality work. Typical phases include initial assessment and design, demolition of existing fixtures, rough-in plumbing and electrical work, installation of waterproofing and structural elements, followed by fixtures, cabinetry, tiles, and finishes. Each phase is scheduled to allow inspection and corrections before moving to the next step. Phased planning helps prioritize critical tasks, spread out expenses, coordinate labor efficiently, and maintain partial usability of the bathroom if needed, resulting in a smoother, more controlled renovation process.
