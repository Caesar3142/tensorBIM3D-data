The insulation thickness you should use depends on climate, the part of the building (roof, wall, or floor), and the insulation material’s thermal conductivity. The goal is to achieve a suitable thermal resistance, often expressed as R-value, rather than focusing on thickness alone.

In warm or tropical climates where the main goal is to reduce heat gain, roof insulation is the most important. Roofs receive the highest solar exposure. A typical effective roof insulation thickness ranges from about 50 mm to 100 mm for materials like rigid foam boards or mineral wool. If the climate is very hot, 75 to 100 mm is commonly recommended to significantly reduce indoor heat buildup. Increasing roof insulation usually provides the greatest return on investment.

For external walls in warm climates, insulation thickness is usually slightly less than the roof. Around 40 to 75 mm of rigid foam or mineral wool is often sufficient, depending on wall construction. In very hot regions, 75 mm may be preferred, especially on west-facing walls. In milder climates, 40 to 50 mm may already provide noticeable improvement.

In colder climates where heating is dominant, insulation thickness increases substantially. Roof insulation may range from 150 mm to 300 mm depending on the required R-value. Wall insulation may range from 100 mm to 200 mm or more. Floors above unheated spaces may require 50 to 100 mm or more depending on local codes.

Material choice matters. For example, expanded polystyrene (EPS), extruded polystyrene (XPS), polyurethane foam, and mineral wool all have different thermal conductivity values. Materials with lower thermal conductivity achieve the same insulation performance with less thickness. For example, polyurethane foam provides higher thermal resistance per millimeter compared to mineral wool, so thinner layers can achieve similar performance.

Another factor is where insulation is placed. Continuous external insulation is generally more effective than insulation placed only between structural members because it reduces thermal bridging. Even moderate thickness can perform well if properly installed without gaps.

Local building codes often specify minimum required R-values for roofs and walls. It is always best to design insulation thickness based on target R-value rather than guessing thickness. A simple principle is that roofs should have the highest insulation level, followed by walls, and then floors depending on climate.

In summary, for hot climates, roof insulation of 50 to 100 mm and wall insulation of 40 to 75 mm are common practical ranges. For colder climates, thickness increases significantly. The exact thickness should be selected based on climate zone, material properties, and desired energy performance rather than a single universal number.
