## Design house in coastal windy area ##

To design a house in a coastal windy area, prioritize aerodynamic form, durable materials, and controlled ventilation. Use a simple, low-profile roof such as a hip roof rather than large overhang-heavy gables to reduce wind uplift pressure. The building mass should be compact and well-anchored with reinforced structural connections, especially between roof, walls, and foundation. Elevate the house slightly if flooding or storm surge is a risk, using stilts or a raised plinth. Position major openings to capture cooling sea breezes, but protect them with impact-resistant glazing, storm shutters, or recessed window designs to withstand strong winds and salt exposure. Choose corrosion-resistant materials such as treated timber, stainless steel fittings, concrete, or fiber cement to handle salty air. Landscaping with windbreak vegetation can filter strong gusts without fully blocking airflow. The overall design should balance openness for natural cooling with structural resilience against coastal wind forces.
