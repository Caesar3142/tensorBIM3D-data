Designing a house on a corner lot gives you both opportunities and challenges. You have two street frontages, which means more visibility, more natural light potential, and more access points, but also less privacy and more exposure to noise and sun.

The first step is deciding which street will function as the primary frontage. Even though it is a corner lot, it helps to establish one main entrance and one secondary side. Typically, the quieter or less busy street becomes the main façade with the primary entrance and living spaces.

Place the main entrance facing the preferred street, slightly recessed or sheltered with a porch or overhang for privacy and weather protection. The secondary street frontage can be treated more solidly, especially if it receives strong afternoon sun. Service areas such as bathrooms, staircases, storage rooms, or kitchen walls can be positioned along the more exposed side to act as buffers.

Corner lots are ideal for maximizing natural light and ventilation. You can place windows on two adjacent façades, which makes cross ventilation easier to achieve. Living and dining areas can be positioned at the corner of the house to benefit from dual-aspect windows, creating a brighter and more open feeling. However, consider privacy and traffic views when sizing those windows.

If the lot allows, create a private outdoor space by wrapping the house in an L-shape. This forms a semi-enclosed courtyard that is shielded from both streets. The courtyard can serve as a garden, terrace, or outdoor living area while maintaining privacy.

Parking placement is important. You can position the driveway and carport along the secondary street to reduce disruption to the main façade. This also improves traffic safety by separating pedestrian and vehicle access.

For two-storey houses, consider orienting upper-floor bedrooms away from direct street exposure when possible. If bedrooms face the street, use recessed balconies, vertical screens, or planting to improve privacy.

Sun orientation should also guide layout decisions. If one street faces west, minimize large openings on that side or use strong shading elements. Use the other side for larger windows and main living areas if it offers better sunlight control.

Landscaping plays a major role in corner lots. Because two sides are exposed, planting trees, hedges, and layered greenery helps soften the building edges and improve privacy while still maintaining openness.

In summary, a well-designed corner lot house establishes a clear primary frontage, uses the secondary street strategically for services or parking, maximizes dual-aspect light and ventilation, creates protected private outdoor areas, and manages privacy and sun exposure carefully. Proper orientation and zoning allow you to fully benefit from the openness of a corner site.
