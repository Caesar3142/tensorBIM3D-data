A maximum building footprint of 60 m² is small, but it is absolutely workable and quite common in dense urban housing. The key shift in thinking is that the footprint alone does not define how livable the house can be. What matters more is how you use vertical space, how efficiently you plan rooms, and how well light and ventilation are handled. With a disciplined layout, a 60 m² footprint can support a comfortable home.

With a footprint this size, building vertically becomes the most effective strategy. A single-storey house of 60 m² can work for a compact one- or two-bedroom layout, but it will feel tight for a family unless the design is extremely efficient. A two-storey house immediately doubles the usable floor area to about 120 m², which is sufficient for a small family house with good comfort. If local regulations allow three storeys, the total area can reach 180 m², which offers even more flexibility while keeping the ground coverage minimal.

On the ground floor, space should be prioritized for shared daily activities. An open-plan living, dining, and kitchen area works best because it avoids corridors and makes the space feel larger than it actually is. A small bathroom and storage can be tucked into corners or under the stairs. If needed, a compact study or guest room can be included, but multifunctional spaces are usually more effective at this scale.

Upper floors are better suited for private functions. Bedrooms, bathrooms, and possibly a small family area or study can be arranged efficiently because furniture placement is more predictable and rooms can be more compact. Bathrooms should be stacked vertically above each other to simplify plumbing and reduce construction cost. Stair placement is critical, as it occupies space on every floor; a compact straight-run or U-shaped stair is usually the most efficient choice.

Natural light and ventilation become even more important with a small footprint. Every room should ideally receive daylight, either from the façade, a small courtyard, a light well, or skylights. Vertical voids, double-height spaces, or stairwell skylights can dramatically improve the feeling of openness without increasing the footprint. Good ventilation strategies prevent the house from feeling cramped or overheated.

Structurally, a 60 m² footprint is straightforward. Spans are relatively short, so conventional reinforced concrete frames, load-bearing walls, or light steel systems are all viable and economical. Keeping the structural grid simple and consistent across floors will help maximize usable space and control costs.

From a lifestyle perspective, a house with a 60 m² footprint works best when storage is built-in and clutter is minimized. Wall storage, under-stair storage, and multipurpose furniture make a significant difference. Ceiling height also plays a major role; slightly higher ceilings can make small spaces feel much more comfortable and breathable.

In summary, a 60 m² building footprint is not a limitation but a design constraint that encourages smarter planning. With two or three storeys, open layouts, efficient circulation, and good daylight and ventilation, you can create a house that feels comfortable, functional, and much larger than its footprint suggests.
