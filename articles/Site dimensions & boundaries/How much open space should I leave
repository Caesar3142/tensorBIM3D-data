How much open space you should leave depends on three main factors: local regulations, environmental comfort (light, air, drainage), and how small your building footprint already is. Since you mentioned a maximum footprint of 60 m² and a compact urban context, open space is not a luxury but a functional necessity that directly affects how livable the house will feel.

From a regulatory point of view, many urban planning rules require 20–40% of the plot to remain as open space, including setbacks, yards, or courtyards. On a small plot, this often translates to at least one front or rear setback and sometimes side setbacks if required. Even if regulations are flexible, you should still think in similar proportions, because leaving too little open space usually results in poor daylight, weak ventilation, and long-term comfort problems.

From a design and comfort perspective, a good rule of thumb for small houses is to leave at least 30% of the land area as open space if possible. For example, on a 120 m² plot, this would mean about 35–40 m² of open space. This open space does not need to be one large garden; it can be broken into smaller, purposeful areas such as a front yard, a rear yard, a side strip, or a small internal courtyard or light well.

If the site is very tight and setbacks are minimal, even 15–25% open space can still work if it is designed intelligently. In this case, quality matters more than quantity. A small courtyard of 6–10 m², a narrow light well, or a rear yard of 1.5–2 meters depth can dramatically improve daylight, ventilation, and thermal comfort. These spaces act as lungs for the house, allowing air to move and light to penetrate deep into the interior.

For tropical or warm climates, open space is even more critical. Leaving open areas that allow cross-ventilation and heat release can make the difference between a house that feels cool and one that constantly overheats. Courtyards, ventilated stair voids, and shaded outdoor spaces work together with windows and openings to reduce reliance on mechanical cooling. In such climates, prioritizing open space over maximizing built area usually leads to better long-term comfort.

Open space also plays a role in drainage, maintenance, and future flexibility. Permeable ground areas help manage rainwater, reduce flooding risk, and lower heat buildup around the house. Small gardens, even narrow ones, improve microclimate and visual comfort. These spaces can later be adapted into patios, utility areas, or extensions if regulations allow.

In practical terms, for a small urban house with a 60 m² footprint, a good target is to leave around 25–35% of the plot as open space, with at least one well-designed outdoor or semi-outdoor area that directly connects to interior living spaces. If the plot is extremely constrained, even a smaller percentage can work, as long as the open space is positioned to bring light, air, and breathing room into the heart of the house.

In short, open space should not be treated as leftover land but as an active design element. When carefully planned, even a small amount of open space can greatly improve comfort, livability, and the perceived size of a compact house.
