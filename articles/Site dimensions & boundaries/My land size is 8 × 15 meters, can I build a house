Yes, you can definitely build a house on an 8 × 15 meter plot, and this land size is actually quite common in dense urban areas. With a total area of 120 square meters, the key to success is not the size itself but how efficiently the space is planned in relation to local regulations, lifestyle needs, and building height. Many comfortable and functional houses are built on plots this size or even smaller.

The first thing to check is local zoning and building regulations. Setbacks, maximum building coverage, height limits, and requirements for light and ventilation will determine how much of the land you can actually build on. In many urban contexts, you may be allowed to build on 60–80% of the plot. This would give you a ground-floor footprint of roughly 70–95 square meters, which is enough for a compact but well-functioning house.

On an 8 × 15 meter site, building vertically is often the most practical strategy. A two-storey house is very common on plots of this size and allows you to separate public and private spaces efficiently. For example, the ground floor can accommodate a living area, dining space, kitchen, bathroom, and possibly one small bedroom or study, while the upper floor can contain two or three bedrooms and an additional bathroom. If regulations allow three storeys, even more flexibility becomes possible.

Layout efficiency is critical on a narrow plot. Open-plan living areas work very well because they reduce the need for corridors and make the interior feel larger than it actually is. Stairs should be compact and well positioned, often along one side of the house or near the center, to minimize wasted space. Bathrooms and kitchens should be stacked vertically to simplify plumbing and reduce construction cost.

Natural light and ventilation need special attention, especially if neighboring buildings are close. Windows at the front and rear are essential, and if the plot allows, a small internal courtyard, light well, or air shaft can dramatically improve daylight and airflow. High windows, skylights, and clerestory openings are also very effective on small plots where side windows may be limited.

From a structural point of view, an 8 × 15 meter house is straightforward to build. Simple reinforced concrete frames, load-bearing walls, or light steel structures all work well at this scale. Keeping spans modest and aligning walls and columns between floors will help control costs and simplify construction.

In terms of livable size, a well-designed house on this plot can comfortably provide 90–160 square meters of total floor area if built over two storeys, which is more than sufficient for a small family. The quality of space, natural light, ventilation, and storage will matter far more than the raw numbers.

In conclusion, an 8 × 15 meter plot is absolutely suitable for a house. With thoughtful planning, efficient layout, and a willingness to build vertically, you can create a comfortable, modern, and highly livable home that fits well within this land size and works effectively in an urban environment.
