Yes, a site that is 6 meters wide is absolutely possible to build on, and in many cities this width is quite common for dense urban housing. While it is narrow, it is still workable as long as the design is carefully planned and responds well to the constraints. Many successful townhouses, shophouses, and urban family homes are built on plots that are 5 to 6 meters wide or even less.

The key challenge with a 6-meter-wide site is layout efficiency. Every square meter matters, so circulation space must be minimized and rooms must be sized realistically rather than generously. Open-plan layouts are especially effective, as they reduce internal walls and corridors and make the interior feel wider than it actually is. Combining living, dining, and kitchen spaces into one continuous area is a common and successful strategy for narrow houses.

Building vertically is usually the most practical approach on a 6-meter-wide site. A two- or three-storey house allows you to achieve sufficient floor area without overcrowding the plan. The ground floor can be used for shared functions such as living, dining, kitchen, and a bathroom, while upper floors can accommodate bedrooms and more private spaces. This vertical separation also improves privacy and noise control within the house.

Natural light and ventilation require special attention at this width. If side setbacks are limited or nonexistent, daylight must primarily come from the front and rear façades. To improve interior comfort, many narrow houses use internal courtyards, light wells, or air shafts, even if they are small. These vertical voids bring light and air into the middle of the house and prevent deep interior spaces from becoming dark and stuffy. Skylights and high-level windows are also very effective solutions.

Stair placement is critical in a narrow house. A compact, straight-run or U-shaped staircase placed along one side of the house or near the center usually works best. Poorly placed stairs can easily consume too much width and disrupt the layout, so they should be designed early, not added later. Integrating storage under the stairs is a good way to recover otherwise wasted space.

Structurally, a 6-meter-wide house is not difficult to build. Typical spans are modest, so conventional reinforced concrete frames, load-bearing walls, or light steel structures work well and are cost-effective. Keeping the structural grid simple and aligning walls and columns between floors will help control construction costs and simplify detailing.

From a lifestyle perspective, narrow houses rely heavily on visual openness rather than large room sizes. Using light colors, simple finishes, large openings, and good ceiling heights can make the house feel much more spacious than its actual width suggests. Carefully designed furniture, built-in storage, and uncluttered interiors are also essential to maintain comfort.

In summary, a 6-meter-wide site is definitely buildable and can support a comfortable, modern home. Success depends on smart vertical planning, efficient layouts, good daylight and ventilation strategies, and disciplined design decisions. With thoughtful planning, a narrow house can feel airy, functional, and highly livable despite its limited width.
