## Accent wall ##

An accent wall in a bathroom is a single wall that is visually distinguished from the others to create a focal point and enhance the room’s design. This can be achieved using different materials, colors, or textures, such as patterned tiles, bold paint, natural stone, or wood panels. Common choices for an accent wall include the wall behind the vanity, shower, or bathtub to draw attention to key features. The accent wall adds depth, contrast, and personality to the bathroom, while complementing the overall color scheme and finishes of the space.
