## Ensuite bathroom layout ##

An ensuite bathroom is directly connected to a bedroom, typically the master, providing private and convenient access. Its layout often prioritizes comfort and luxury, with a larger footprint than a standard bathroom. Common arrangements include a toilet in a separate nook or behind a partition for privacy, a sink or double vanity along one wall, and a shower and/or bathtub in the wet zone, sometimes separated by glass partitions. Ample circulation space, usually at least 24–30 inches (61–76 cm) in front of fixtures, allows comfortable movement. Storage, lighting, ventilation, and easy access from the bedroom are key considerations, while careful placement of wet and dry zones ensures hygiene and prevents water from spreading into sleeping areas.
