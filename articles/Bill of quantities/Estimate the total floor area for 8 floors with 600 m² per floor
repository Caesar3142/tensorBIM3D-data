To estimate the total floor area, you simply multiply the number of floors by the floor area per floor.

With 8 floors and each floor having an area of 600 m², the total gross floor area is:

8 × 600 m² = 4,800 m²

So, the estimated total floor area of the building is 4,800 square meters. This value represents the gross floor area assuming every floor has the same usable footprint and does not yet account for exclusions such as mechanical floors, roof structures, or areas that may not be counted under local zoning or building regulations.
