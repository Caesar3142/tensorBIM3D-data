## Help me reduce humidity naturally ##

To reduce humidity naturally, focus on increasing continuous airflow and limiting moisture accumulation inside the house. Maximize cross-ventilation by placing operable openings on opposite walls and using louvered or casement windows that can stay open safely during light rain. Incorporate high-level vents or clerestory windows to release warm, moist air through the stack effect. Use breathable building materials such as lime plaster, clay finishes, or untreated wood that help regulate moisture instead of trapping it. Ensure the house receives adequate sunlight, as sun exposure helps dry interior surfaces and prevent mold growth. Avoid dense landscaping directly against exterior walls, and provide proper roof overhangs and drainage to prevent rainwater from increasing ground moisture near the foundation. Elevated floors, ventilated roof spaces, and shaded courtyards that promote air movement can further help maintain lower indoor humidity without relying heavily on mechanical dehumidifiers.
