Designing proper drainage is about making sure water never stays where it can cause damage. Good drainage protects the structure, improves comfort, prevents dampness and mold, and greatly extends the life of the house. Drainage should be planned from the very beginning, because fixing water problems later is difficult and expensive.

The first step is understanding how water moves on your site. Rainwater should always flow away from the building, never toward it. This means the ground around the house must be sloped outward, typically with a gentle fall of about 1–2 percent for the first few meters. Even on small plots, this slight slope is critical to prevent water from collecting near foundations and seeping into floors or walls.

Roof drainage is the main source of water during heavy rain. Every roof surface must have a clear path for water to exit quickly. Sloped roofs should direct water toward gutters, while flat roofs must still have a minimum slope, usually around 1–2 percent, toward roof drains or scuppers. Flat roofs are never truly flat. Gutters and downpipes must be sized to handle local rainfall intensity and should discharge water directly into ground drains, soak pits, or stormwater channels, not onto walkways or beside foundations.

Surface drainage at ground level is just as important. Hard surfaces such as driveways, terraces, and walkways should be gently sloped toward drains or landscaped areas, not toward the house. Where space allows, using permeable surfaces such as gravel, grass blocks, or planted areas helps water soak into the ground instead of running across hard concrete and creating puddles or flooding.

Subsurface drainage may be necessary on sites with soft soil, high groundwater, or poor natural drainage. This can include gravel layers, perforated drain pipes, or French drains around the building to intercept and redirect groundwater away from foundations. These systems are hidden but extremely important for long-term stability and dryness, especially in wet climates.

Bathrooms, kitchens, and other wet areas need careful internal drainage design. Floor levels in bathrooms should be slightly lower than adjacent spaces to prevent overflow water from spreading. Floor drains should be placed at the lowest points and connected to properly vented drainage pipes. Waterproofing membranes under floors and behind walls are essential companions to drainage; drainage alone is not enough without proper waterproofing.

Downpipes and site drains must always be accessible for maintenance. Leaves, dirt, and debris will eventually block drains if they cannot be cleaned. Providing inspection openings, removable grates, and accessible clean-out points prevents small issues from becoming major problems during heavy rain.

If the site is small and urban, drainage often needs to be more deliberate. Courtyards, light wells, and narrow side spaces should always include floor drains connected to the main drainage system. These areas easily become water traps if not carefully detailed, especially during storms.

In summary, proper drainage comes from guiding water away at every level: roof, ground surface, foundation, and interior wet areas. Sloping surfaces correctly, providing clear drainage paths, combining hard drainage with permeable ground, and planning for maintenance are the keys. When drainage is designed as a system rather than as isolated elements, the house stays dry, healthy, and durable for decades.
