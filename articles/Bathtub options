## Bathtub options ##

Bathtub options vary in style, material, and installation to suit different bathroom designs and user preferences. Common types include freestanding tubs, which are placed away from walls and often serve as a centerpiece; built-in or alcove tubs, installed against three walls for space efficiency; drop-in tubs, set into a framed deck or platform for a seamless look; corner tubs, designed to fit into angled spaces; and soaking or deep tubs, which provide extra depth for relaxation. Materials can include acrylic, fiberglass, cast iron, stone resin, or copper, affecting durability, heat retention, and aesthetics. The choice depends on available space, plumbing configuration, style, and desired bathing experience.
