## Optimize cost vs durability in material choice ##

To optimize cost versus durability in material choice, prioritize materials that offer long service life with low maintenance rather than focusing only on the lowest upfront price. Use reinforced concrete or well-designed masonry for the main structure because they provide strong durability and resistance to moisture, fire, and pests at a reasonable cost. For exterior finishes, select fiber cement boards, plastered brick, or textured concrete instead of high-maintenance cladding that requires frequent replacement. Choose roofing materials such as coated metal sheets or concrete tiles that balance affordability with weather resistance. Invest strategically in critical components like waterproofing, roof insulation, and corrosion-resistant fasteners, as failures in these areas are expensive to repair later. For interiors, use durable yet economical finishes like ceramic tiles and quality paint rather than premium decorative materials. By allocating budget toward structural integrity and weather protection while simplifying aesthetics, you can achieve long-term durability without exceeding construction costs.
