Comparing the cost between a 1-storey and a 2-storey house depends on land price, structural system, foundation conditions, and total floor area. However, there are general cost trends that help guide decision-making.

For the same total floor area, a 2-storey house is often more cost-efficient per square meter of usable space. This is because the roof and foundation are two of the most expensive components of a house. In a 1-storey house, the entire floor area requires foundation and roofing. In a 2-storey house with the same total area, the foundation and roof cover only half the footprint. This reduces cost per square meter for these components.

For example, if you want 150 m² of total living area, a 1-storey house will require a 150 m² foundation and 150 m² roof. A 2-storey house might only need a 75 m² foundation and 75 m² roof, while the upper floor is supported structurally above. This can reduce costs related to excavation, concrete, roofing materials, and land usage.

However, a 2-storey house requires stronger structural elements. Columns, beams, and foundations must be designed to carry additional loads. Staircases also add cost, both structurally and in terms of space usage. In seismic areas, additional reinforcement may further increase structural cost. Construction labor may also be slightly higher due to vertical work and scaffolding.

A 1-storey house is usually simpler and faster to build. It requires lighter structural elements and may be more suitable for weaker soil conditions. Maintenance and accessibility are also easier, especially for elderly occupants. In some cases, if land is inexpensive and widely available, a 1-storey house can be more economical overall because structural complexity is lower.

Land cost is a major factor. In high land-cost areas, a 2-storey house is often more economical because it maximizes floor area on a smaller footprint. In rural or low land-cost areas, a 1-storey house may be more practical and cost-effective.

Utility costs can differ slightly. A 2-storey house may have slightly higher structural and stair costs but lower roof and foundation costs. Mechanical and plumbing layouts can be efficient in both, but stacked bathrooms in 2-storey houses can reduce piping lengths.

In general, if comparing equal total floor areas, a 2-storey house often has lower cost per square meter but higher structural complexity. A 1-storey house has simpler construction and easier accessibility but may require more land and larger foundation and roof areas.

The final cost comparison depends on local labor rates, material prices, soil conditions, and land value, so a detailed quantity takeoff and cost estimate is necessary for accurate evaluation.
