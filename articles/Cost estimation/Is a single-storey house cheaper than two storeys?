In many cases, a single-storey house can be cheaper, but it is not automatically cheaper than a two-storey house. The real cost difference depends on land size, total floor area, foundation and roof costs, and how efficiently the house is planned. Understanding where the money actually goes helps explain why the answer is often “it depends.”

For the same total floor area, a single-storey house usually costs more to build than a two-storey house. This is because single-storey houses require a larger foundation and a larger roof area. Foundations and roofs are among the most expensive parts of a house per square meter. Spreading everything across the ground increases excavation, concrete, roofing structure, waterproofing, and finishing costs.

A two-storey house, by stacking space vertically, reduces the footprint. This means a smaller foundation and smaller roof relative to the total usable area. Structurally, adding a second storey does increase costs slightly due to slabs, stairs, and columns, but these are often cheaper than expanding the foundation and roof to cover the same area in one level.

Single-storey houses can be cheaper when the total area is small. For example, a compact 50–70 m² house on one level is often cheaper than a two-storey house of the same size, because there is no upper floor slab, no staircase, and simpler structural detailing. In this range, simplicity wins.

Land cost is also a major factor. If land is expensive or limited, a two-storey house is usually more cost-effective overall because it gives you more usable space on the same plot. If land is cheap and plentiful, a single-storey house can be simpler and sometimes cheaper because construction is straightforward and access is easier.

Construction efficiency matters as well. Single-storey houses are easier and faster to build, which can reduce labor costs and construction time. Two-storey houses require more coordination, temporary works, and safety measures during construction, which adds some cost. However, this is often offset by savings in foundation and roof size.

Long-term costs should also be considered. Single-storey houses are easier to maintain and modify over time, especially for elderly occupants. Two-storey houses may have higher long-term maintenance costs for stairs, upper façades, and roofing access, although these differences are usually modest.

In summary, a single-storey house is cheaper only when the total floor area is small and land is not a constraint. For larger houses or small plots, a two-storey house is often more cost-efficient because it reduces foundation and roof costs per square meter. The cheapest option is not about the number of storeys alone, but about building compactly, efficiently, and in proportion to your needs.
