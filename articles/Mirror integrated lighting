## Mirror integrated lighting ##

Mirror integrated lighting in bathrooms combines illumination directly within or around the mirror to provide even, shadow-free light for grooming tasks. These mirrors often feature built-in LED strips along the edges or behind the surface, producing uniform brightness across the face. This type of lighting improves visibility for shaving, makeup, or skincare and can reduce the need for separate vanity lights. Adjustable brightness and color temperature features are common, allowing users to switch between warm and cool light depending on preference or task. Properly designed mirror lighting enhances both functionality and the aesthetic appeal of the bathroom.
