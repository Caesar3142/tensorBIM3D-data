The typical dimensions of a residential stair are determined by safety, comfort, building regulations, and ergonomic principles. Stairs serve as vertical circulation elements that connect different floor levels within a house, and their proportions must ensure that users can ascend and descend safely and comfortably. The key dimensions of a stair include its width, riser height, tread depth, total run, headroom clearance, and landing dimensions. Each of these elements works together to create a balanced and functional stair design.

In most residential buildings, the typical stair width ranges between 80 and 100 centimeters. An 80-centimeter width is often considered the practical minimum for a private house, allowing a single person to move comfortably. However, a width of 90 to 100 centimeters is preferred because it feels more spacious and allows easier movement of furniture between floors. In larger or more luxurious homes, stair widths may extend beyond 110 centimeters, especially when the stair serves as a central architectural feature.

The riser height, which is the vertical distance between each step, typically ranges from 17 to 19 centimeters in residential construction. A riser height of about 17.5 to 18 centimeters is very common because it offers a comfortable climbing rhythm for most adults. If the riser is too high, climbing becomes tiring and potentially unsafe; if too low, the stair becomes unnecessarily long and occupies more floor space. Building regulations in many regions set maximum riser heights to ensure safety.

The tread depth, which is the horizontal surface where the foot steps, typically ranges from 25 to 28 centimeters. A tread depth of around 26 to 28 centimeters is considered comfortable because it allows most of the foot to rest securely on the step. The relationship between riser height and tread depth follows ergonomic formulas, often approximated by the rule that twice the riser height plus the tread depth equals about 60 to 64 centimeters, reflecting the average human step length.

The total length or run of the stair depends on the number of steps and the tread depth. For example, in a house with a floor-to-floor height of approximately 2.8 to 3.0 meters, there may be around 15 to 18 risers. This typically results in a horizontal run of approximately 3.5 to 4.5 meters, depending on the exact tread depth and configuration. Straight-run stairs require the most linear space, while L-shaped or U-shaped stairs with landings can reduce the required horizontal length and fit more compactly within a floor plan.

Landings are essential components of stair design. A landing is typically required after a certain number of steps or when the stair changes direction. The minimum landing depth is generally at least equal to the width of the stair, usually around 90 to 100 centimeters. Landings provide resting space, improve safety, and allow changes in direction without steep turns.

Headroom clearance is another critical dimension. Residential building standards usually require a minimum vertical clearance of about 200 to 210 centimeters measured from the stair tread to the ceiling or overhead structure. This ensures that users can ascend and descend without hitting their heads. Insufficient headroom is considered a serious design flaw and safety hazard.

Handrails are typically installed at a height of about 85 to 95 centimeters above the stair tread. In many houses, at least one handrail is required when the stair has more than a certain number of steps. In wider stairs, handrails may be installed on both sides. The thickness and grip size of handrails are designed to allow comfortable grasping.

In terms of slope, residential stairs generally have an angle between 30 and 37 degrees. Steeper stairs save space but reduce comfort and safety, while shallower stairs require more floor area but feel easier to climb.

In summary, a typical residential stair has a width of about 80 to 100 centimeters, riser height between 17 and 19 centimeters, tread depth between 25 and 28 centimeters, headroom clearance of at least 200 centimeters, and landings at least equal in depth to the stair width. These proportions are widely accepted standards in residential architecture and are designed to balance safety, comfort, and efficient use of space.
