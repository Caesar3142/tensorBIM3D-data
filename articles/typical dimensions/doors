The typical dimensions of residential doors depend on their function, location within the house, and whether accessibility requirements must be met. Doors are designed not only to allow passage but also to ensure privacy, safety, ventilation control, acoustic separation, and aesthetic proportion within the overall architectural layout. While dimensions vary by country and building code, there are widely accepted standards used in most residential construction.

Interior doors, which are used for bedrooms, living rooms, and general spaces inside the house, commonly have a width between 70 and 90 centimeters. The most frequently used standard width is 80 centimeters because it provides comfortable passage for most people and allows furniture to pass through without difficulty. In smaller homes or apartments, 70-centimeter doors are sometimes used to save space, though they feel slightly narrower. The standard height for interior doors is typically 200 to 210 centimeters. In many modern homes, 210 centimeters is increasingly common because it creates better visual proportion with higher ceilings. Door thickness usually ranges from 3.5 to 4.5 centimeters, depending on material and acoustic requirements. Solid-core doors tend to be thicker and heavier than hollow-core doors.

Bathroom doors are often slightly narrower than bedroom doors. They commonly range from 60 to 80 centimeters in width, with 70 centimeters being typical in standard homes. In compact houses, 60-centimeter bathroom doors may be used to conserve space, though this can feel restrictive. Height remains similar to other interior doors, generally around 200 centimeters. Because bathrooms require privacy, these doors often include internal locks and may incorporate ventilation gaps or undercuts at the bottom to allow airflow.

The main entrance door, sometimes called the front door, is generally larger and more prominent than interior doors. Its width usually ranges from 90 to 100 centimeters, though 90 centimeters is very common. In higher-end or larger homes, the entrance door may be 100 centimeters wide or more to create a grander appearance. The height typically ranges from 210 to 240 centimeters, with taller doors being popular in modern architectural design. Entrance doors are also thicker, often between 4 and 5 centimeters or more, to provide better security, insulation, and durability. Some homes use double entrance doors, which consist of two panels and can have a total combined width ranging from 120 to 180 centimeters. This configuration creates a strong visual statement and allows wide access when needed.

Sliding doors are frequently used for patios, balconies, or garden access. These doors typically have widths ranging from 150 to 300 centimeters, depending on how many panels are included. Height is usually between 210 and 240 centimeters to align with standard ceiling heights and maximize natural light. Sliding doors often use large glass panels framed in aluminum, uPVC, or wood. Because of their wide openings, they require strong structural support above the opening.

Closet doors are generally smaller or lighter compared to room doors. Hinged closet doors often follow similar dimensions to interior doors but may be narrower, such as 60 to 80 centimeters. Sliding closet doors vary widely depending on wardrobe width and can span from 120 centimeters to over 240 centimeters in total width.

In addition to width and height, clearance and swing space are important design considerations. A standard hinged door requires adequate space for the swing radius, which equals the door width. For example, an 80-centimeter door requires approximately 80 centimeters of clear space in its swing direction. In smaller rooms, designers sometimes use sliding or pocket doors to save space and eliminate swing interference.

Accessibility requirements influence door dimensions in certain homes. Universal design or wheelchair-accessible houses often require minimum door widths of 80 to 90 centimeters to allow comfortable passage. In such cases, clear opening width becomes critical, and door hardware placement is also carefully planned.

Door frame thickness and head height are usually aligned with structural and aesthetic standards. The top of most interior doors aligns at around 200 to 210 centimeters above finished floor level. In houses with higher ceilings, doors may be extended proportionally to maintain balanced visual appearance.

Overall, interior doors typically measure about 80 centimeters wide and 200 to 210 centimeters high, bathroom doors range from 60 to 80 centimeters wide, main entrance doors range from 90 to 100 centimeters wide and 210 to 240 centimeters high, and sliding patio doors can extend from 150 to 300 centimeters in width. These dimensions represent practical standards in residential architecture and are selected to balance comfort, functionality, structural requirements, and aesthetic design.
