The typical dimensions of a residential garage depend primarily on the number of vehicles it is designed to accommodate, the size of those vehicles, and whether additional storage or workspace is included. Garages are generally categorized as single-car garages, double-car garages, and larger multi-car or extended garages. The dimensions must account not only for the physical size of the vehicle but also for door swing clearance, walking space around the vehicle, storage cabinets, and sometimes mechanical equipment such as water heaters or electrical panels.

A single-car garage is commonly designed with internal dimensions of approximately 2.7 meters by 5.4 meters. The width of 2.7 meters is considered the minimum practical dimension that allows a standard passenger car to fit while still providing limited clearance on each side. However, many designers prefer a slightly wider dimension, such as 3.0 meters, to allow easier entry and exit from the vehicle. The depth of around 5.4 meters accommodates most compact and mid-size cars, which typically range from 4.2 to 4.8 meters in length. For larger vehicles such as SUVs or pickup trucks, a depth closer to 6.0 meters may be more appropriate to ensure sufficient front and rear clearance.

A double-car garage is typically designed to accommodate two vehicles parked side by side. The common minimum internal dimension is approximately 5.4 meters by 5.4 meters. This allows two cars, each occupying about 2.4 to 2.7 meters of width, with a narrow clearance between them. However, this size can feel tight in daily use. A more comfortable double-car garage often measures about 6.0 meters by 6.0 meters, providing improved clearance for opening doors and moving around vehicles. In homes where storage shelves or workbenches are included along the walls, the width may extend to 6.5 meters or more.

Garage door dimensions vary according to garage size. A standard single garage door typically measures between 2.4 and 2.7 meters in width and about 2.1 to 2.4 meters in height. Double garage doors commonly range from 4.8 to 5.5 meters in width. In some designs, instead of one large double door, two separate single doors are used. Door height may increase to 2.4 meters or higher when accommodating taller vehicles such as vans.

The ceiling height in a residential garage is generally around 2.4 to 2.7 meters. This height allows adequate clearance for vehicles and provides space for overhead garage door mechanisms. In homes where overhead storage racks are installed, additional height may be desirable. For garages intended to house larger vehicles or car lifts, ceiling heights of 3.0 meters or more may be required.

In addition to vehicle space, garages often include circulation and storage areas. Designers typically aim for at least 60 to 75 centimeters of clearance along the sides of vehicles for comfortable movement. If cabinets or storage shelves are installed along the wall, an additional depth of 30 to 60 centimeters must be considered. Workbench areas may require about 60 centimeters in depth and 120 centimeters or more in width, depending on usage.

Attached garages are usually integrated into the house structure and share one or more walls with the main building. In such cases, a fire-rated door between the garage and the house is commonly required by building regulations. This connecting door is usually similar in size to an interior door, often around 80 to 90 centimeters wide and 200 centimeters high. Detached garages, on the other hand, are separate structures and may have slightly different dimensional flexibility.

The driveway approach and turning radius also influence garage dimensions. Sufficient clearance must be provided in front of the garage for vehicle maneuvering. In narrow urban lots, designers carefully calculate driveway width and turning space to ensure safe and convenient access.

In summary, a typical single-car garage measures around 2.7 by 5.4 meters, while a more comfortable size is approximately 3.0 by 6.0 meters. A double-car garage commonly measures about 5.4 by 5.4 meters at minimum, with 6.0 by 6.0 meters being more comfortable. Ceiling heights generally range from 2.4 to 2.7 meters. These dimensions represent common residential standards and may be adjusted depending on vehicle size, storage requirements, and local building codes.
