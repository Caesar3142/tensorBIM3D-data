Typical residential house dimensions vary depending on country, building regulations, and market segment, but there are widely accepted standards used in architectural planning. In most modern homes, the ceiling height ranges from approximately 2.6 to 3.0 meters, which provides comfortable spatial proportions and adequate ventilation. Older houses sometimes use a ceiling height of 2.4 meters, while luxury homes may feature ceilings of 3.0 to 3.6 meters, particularly in living rooms and entrance foyers to create a more spacious feeling. In multi-story houses, the floor-to-floor height typically ranges between 2.8 and 3.2 meters, accounting for slab thickness, structural beams, and ceiling finishes. Interior partition walls are usually about 10 to 15 centimeters thick, while exterior structural walls made from brick or reinforced concrete commonly range from 20 to 30 centimeters in thickness.

Door dimensions follow fairly consistent standards. Interior doors are typically between 70 and 90 centimeters wide, with 80 centimeters being one of the most common sizes for bedrooms and general rooms. The standard height for interior doors is around 200 to 210 centimeters, and door thickness usually ranges from 3.5 to 4.5 centimeters. Bathroom doors are often slightly narrower, typically between 60 and 80 centimeters wide, especially in compact homes. The main entrance door is generally wider and taller, commonly measuring between 90 and 100 centimeters in width and 210 to 240 centimeters in height. In larger or more luxurious houses, double entrance doors may have a combined width ranging from 120 to 180 centimeters. Sliding patio doors, which connect indoor living spaces to outdoor areas, typically range from 150 to 300 centimeters in width and 210 to 240 centimeters in height.

Window dimensions are also standardized according to room function. Bedroom windows commonly measure between 60 and 120 centimeters in width and 90 to 120 centimeters in height. Living room windows are usually larger to allow more natural light, often ranging from 120 to 240 centimeters in width and 120 to 180 centimeters in height. Kitchen windows typically fall within 60 to 120 centimeters in width and 60 to 120 centimeters in height, often positioned above countertops. Bathroom windows are generally smaller for privacy, commonly measuring 40 to 60 centimeters wide and 40 to 80 centimeters high. The window sill height from the finished floor is typically between 75 and 100 centimeters, while the top of the window often aligns with door head height at approximately 200 to 210 centimeters.

Bedroom sizes vary depending on whether the room is intended as a small bedroom, standard bedroom, or master bedroom. A small bedroom, often used for children or guests, commonly measures around 2.7 by 3.0 meters. A standard bedroom typically measures about 3.0 by 3.6 meters, which comfortably accommodates a queen-sized bed and wardrobe. Master bedrooms are larger, generally ranging from 3.6 by 4.5 meters to 4.5 by 5.0 meters or more in higher-end homes. These larger rooms often include additional circulation space, built-in closets, or access to a private bathroom.

Living room dimensions depend heavily on the overall house size and layout. A small living room may measure approximately 3.0 by 3.6 meters. A more standard living room often measures around 3.6 by 4.5 meters, allowing sufficient space for a sofa set, coffee table, and entertainment unit. In open-plan or larger houses, living rooms may measure 4.5 by 6.0 meters or even larger, especially when combined with dining areas in a single open space concept.

Kitchen sizes also vary according to layout type. A compact kitchen may measure about 2.4 by 2.4 meters, often arranged in a single-wall or galley configuration. A standard residential kitchen commonly measures around 3.0 by 3.0 meters, providing adequate workspace and storage. Larger kitchens may measure 3.6 by 4.5 meters or more, especially when incorporating an island counter. Standard kitchen counter height is typically between 85 and 92 centimeters, designed ergonomically for standing food preparation. Upper cabinets are usually installed so that their lower edge sits approximately 135 to 150 centimeters above the floor.

Bathroom dimensions are determined by the number of fixtures included. A small bathroom, containing a toilet and sink, may measure about 1.2 by 2.4 meters. A standard full bathroom, including a toilet, sink, and shower, often measures around 1.5 by 2.7 meters. A master bathroom may range from 2.4 by 3.0 meters or larger, allowing space for a bathtub and separate shower. The minimum recommended shower area is typically 80 by 80 centimeters, while standard bathtubs usually range from 150 to 180 centimeters in length. Adequate clearance around a toilet typically requires about 75 centimeters in width and at least 120 centimeters in depth for comfortable use.

Stair dimensions in residential houses are also fairly standardized to ensure safety and comfort. Stair width usually ranges between 80 and 100 centimeters. The riser height commonly falls between 17 and 19 centimeters, while tread depth typically ranges from 25 to 28 centimeters. Minimum headroom clearance above the stair is usually about 200 to 210 centimeters to prevent head impact.

Garage dimensions depend on vehicle capacity. A single-car garage commonly measures about 2.7 by 5.4 meters, though a more comfortable width is closer to 3.0 meters. A double-car garage typically measures around 5.4 by 5.4 meters, while more spacious designs may extend to 6.0 by 6.0 meters. Standard garage door widths are generally between 2.4 and 2.7 meters for a single car and 4.8 to 5.5 meters for double-car access.

Hallways and circulation spaces are designed to allow comfortable movement. The minimum hallway width is typically about 90 centimeters, though a more comfortable width ranges from 100 to 120 centimeters, especially in larger homes.

These dimensions represent common residential standards and serve as practical guidelines during architectural planning, 3D modeling, interior design, and construction documentation. Actual requirements should always be verified according to local building codes and accessibility regulations.
