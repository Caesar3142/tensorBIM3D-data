For soft soil, the foundation must be chosen very carefully because the main problem is not strength but excessive settlement. Soft soil, such as clay, peat, loose silt, or reclaimed land, cannot safely carry building loads using shallow foundations alone without risk of uneven settlement, cracking, and long-term structural damage. The right foundation system is one that either transfers loads to deeper, stronger soil or spreads loads so evenly that settlement remains within acceptable limits.

The most reliable solution for soft soil is a pile foundation. Piles transfer building loads down to deeper soil layers that have sufficient bearing capacity. For houses and low-rise buildings, this commonly means precast concrete piles, bored piles, or mini piles, depending on site access and load requirements. Even for a two-storey house, piles are often justified on soft soil because repairing settlement damage later is far more expensive than proper foundations upfront. Piles are especially suitable when the soft layer is deep or when soil conditions vary across the site.

Another commonly used option is a raft foundation, also known as a mat foundation. A raft foundation is a thick reinforced concrete slab that covers most or all of the building footprint, distributing loads over a large area. This reduces contact pressure on the soil and helps the building settle more uniformly. Raft foundations can work well on moderately soft soil where bearing capacity is low but relatively uniform. However, if the soil is very soft or highly compressible, a raft alone may still experience excessive settlement.

In some cases, a combined system is used: a piled raft foundation. This system uses both piles and a raft slab together. The raft helps distribute loads and control differential settlement, while the piles provide additional support and reduce total settlement. For small buildings on soft soil, this can be an efficient compromise, allowing fewer piles than a fully piled foundation while still achieving good performance.

Soil improvement methods are another possible approach, depending on budget and soil conditions. Techniques such as soil replacement, compaction, stone columns, or chemical stabilization can improve the bearing capacity of shallow soil layers. For small houses, limited soil replacement or compaction may be sufficient if the soft layer is shallow. However, these methods require careful geotechnical evaluation and quality control to be effective.

Shallow foundations such as isolated footings or strip footings are generally not recommended on soft soil unless the soil has been improved or the loads are extremely light. On untreated soft soil, shallow foundations are prone to differential settlement, especially when loads are uneven, such as between columns and walls.

In summary, for soft soil, pile foundations are the safest and most commonly recommended solution, even for low-rise residential buildings. Raft foundations can work on moderately soft, uniform soil, and piled rafts offer an efficient hybrid option. The final decision should always be based on a geotechnical soil investigation, as the depth, thickness, and consistency of the soft soil layer ultimately determine which foundation system will perform reliably over the life of the building.
