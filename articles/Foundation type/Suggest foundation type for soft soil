For soft soil conditions, the foundation must distribute loads over a larger area or transfer them to deeper, stronger soil layers. The best foundation type depends on how soft the soil is, the depth of competent bearing strata, groundwater level, and the building load.

If the soil is moderately soft but still has reasonable bearing capacity near the surface, a raft foundation (also called a mat foundation) is often a good solution. A raft foundation spreads the building load over the entire footprint of the structure, reducing pressure on the soil and minimizing differential settlement. This type is commonly used for low-rise residential buildings on soft clay or loose soil. It also works well when column loads are closely spaced.

If the soil is very soft near the surface but stronger soil exists at deeper levels, a pile foundation is usually required. In this case, loads are transferred through piles down to a firm stratum. Piles may be precast concrete piles, bored piles, or driven steel piles, depending on site conditions and construction method. For residential buildings, precast concrete driven piles are common in areas with deep soft clay.

If the soil has low bearing capacity but is relatively uniform and shallow, soil improvement methods can sometimes be used instead of deep foundations. These may include soil compaction, replacement with engineered fill, stone columns, or geotextile reinforcement. After improvement, a shallow foundation such as isolated footings or a raft may become feasible.

For lightly loaded single-storey houses on slightly soft soil, combined footings or strip footings with wider bases may be sufficient. Increasing the footing size reduces soil pressure and improves stability. However, careful settlement analysis is required to avoid uneven movement.

High groundwater levels also influence foundation choice. Raft foundations may require proper waterproofing and drainage systems. Pile foundations may be more stable in such conditions, especially where soil consolidation over time is a concern.

In summary, for soft soil, a raft foundation is commonly suitable for low-rise houses when loads are moderate and soil is uniformly soft. If the soil is very weak or compressible at shallow depth, a pile foundation is usually more appropriate. A proper geotechnical soil investigation is essential before selecting the final foundation type, as soil properties ultimately control the safest and most economical solution.
