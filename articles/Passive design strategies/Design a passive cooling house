Designing a passive cooling house means shaping the building so that it stays comfortable primarily through orientation, airflow, shading, and thermal control rather than relying heavily on air conditioning. The design should reduce heat gain, promote natural ventilation, and release accumulated heat efficiently.

Start with orientation. Position the house so the longer façades face north and south if possible, depending on your hemisphere. This reduces exposure to harsh low-angle east and west sun, which is harder to shade. Minimize large windows on the west side, as afternoon sun creates the highest heat gain.

Layout planning should prioritize cross ventilation. Place operable windows on opposite sides of the house so wind can flow straight through. Align openings across living areas and bedrooms. Open-plan living spaces help air move freely. If the lot allows, leave space on at least one side of the house to create airflow corridors rather than building directly against boundary walls.

Ceiling height is important. Aim for 2.8 to 3.2 meters or higher in main living areas. Warm air rises, so a higher ceiling keeps the occupied zone cooler. If possible, include high-level vents or clerestory windows to allow hot air to escape. This enhances stack ventilation, especially in the evening when outside air cools.

Shading is critical. Use deep roof overhangs, verandas, or pergolas to block direct sunlight from entering windows. Horizontal shading works well for high sun angles, while vertical fins or louvers help block low-angle east and west sun. External shading is far more effective than interior curtains because it stops heat before it enters the building.

Roof design plays a major role in heat control. Use light-colored or reflective roofing materials to reduce solar absorption. Install insulation under the roof and ensure the attic or roof cavity is ventilated. Ridge vents and soffit vents allow hot air trapped under the roof to escape.

Wall construction should limit heat transfer. Use insulated wall systems or cavity walls to slow down heat movement into the interior. Light exterior finishes reflect more solar radiation than dark colors.

Window placement should favor indirect daylight. Use high windows for soft natural lighting without excessive heat. Consider adding a shaded courtyard in the center of the house to provide both daylight and airflow in dense urban environments.

Landscaping contributes significantly. Plant trees on the west and east sides to provide shade. Use vegetation to cool incoming air through evapotranspiration. Avoid large paved areas around the house, as concrete and asphalt store heat and radiate it back into the building.

Interior materials can support passive cooling. Use materials with moderate thermal mass, such as concrete floors or masonry walls, if nighttime temperatures drop significantly. These materials absorb heat during the day and release it at night when windows are opened for cooling.

Finally, combine passive strategies with ceiling fans. Moving air increases perceived cooling without lowering air temperature, allowing comfort at higher temperatures and reducing reliance on mechanical cooling.

A well-designed passive cooling house integrates orientation, shading, ventilation, insulation, roof design, landscaping, and thoughtful material selection. When these elements work together, indoor comfort can be maintained with minimal energy consumption.
