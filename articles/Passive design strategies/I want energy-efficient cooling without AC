## I want energy-efficient cooling without AC ##

To achieve energy-efficient cooling without air conditioning, combine passive design strategies that reduce heat gain and enhance natural airflow. Orient the house to minimize direct west sun exposure and use deep roof overhangs, vertical fins, or external shading devices to block intense sunlight before it reaches the walls and windows. Maximize cross-ventilation by placing operable openings on opposite sides of the house and include high-level vents or clerestory windows to release rising warm air through the stack effect. Use light-colored, reflective roofing and well-insulated ceilings to reduce heat transfer from above. Incorporate shaded courtyards, trees, and vegetation to cool incoming air naturally, and consider thermal mass materials like concrete or brick that can stabilize indoor temperatures when properly shaded. Elevated floors, ventilated roof spaces, and permeable partitions further enhance airflow, creating a cooler and more comfortable interior without relying on mechanical cooling systems.
