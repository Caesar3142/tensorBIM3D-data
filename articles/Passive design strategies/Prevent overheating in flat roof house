## Prevent overheating in flat roof house ##

To prevent overheating in a flat roof house, focus on reducing heat absorption and improving insulation at the roof level, since it receives the most direct solar exposure. Use a light-colored or reflective “cool roof” membrane to minimize solar heat gain, and install high-quality thermal insulation above or below the roof slab to block heat transfer into interior spaces. Creating a ventilated roof system or adding a secondary shading layer such as a pergola, solar panel canopy, or green roof can further reduce surface temperature. Ensure proper cross-ventilation inside the house and include high-level openings to release rising warm air. Deep external shading for windows, especially on the west side, will prevent additional heat buildup. By combining reflective materials, insulation, shading, and airflow management, a flat roof house can remain significantly cooler without relying heavily on air conditioning.
