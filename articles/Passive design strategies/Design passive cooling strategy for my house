## Design passive cooling strategy for my house ##

A passive cooling strategy should begin with proper orientation, placing the longer sides of the house facing north–south (in tropical regions) to reduce harsh east–west sun exposure. Maximize cross-ventilation by aligning operable windows and doors on opposite walls, and include high-level openings or clerestory windows to release rising hot air through stack effect. Incorporate deep roof overhangs, verandas, and external shading devices to block direct solar gain while allowing airflow. Use light-colored, reflective roofing materials and well-insulated ceilings to reduce heat transfer from above. Thermal mass elements such as concrete or brick can help stabilize indoor temperatures when shaded properly. Courtyards, shaded patios, and surrounding vegetation can cool incoming air naturally, while permeable screens and louvers allow ventilation even during rain. By combining shading, airflow management, and heat-resistant materials, the house can remain comfortable with minimal reliance on mechanical air conditioning.
