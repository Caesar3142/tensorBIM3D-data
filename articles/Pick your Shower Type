## Pick your Shower Type ##

Once the location and size of the shower are determined, the shower type and construction can be planned. This is an ideal time to consider your needs, which will help determine the shower’s construction.

Most shower types can be categorized as either a prefabricated shower or a fully custom shower design.

Prefabricated Shower: A prefabricated shower is the most affordable and common option. A prefabricated shower is a stall often made from fiberglass, acrylic, or a composite material manufactured as a single unit. There are many prefabricated shower options; some may include features such as shelves or grab bars. While they are typically more affordable and easy to maintain, they are often considered less stylish and lack the high-end appearance and full features options custom showers may offer.
Custom Shower: A customized shower is designed and built to your specifications. The design process involves planning every shower detail, including the size, wall construction, fixtures, features, materials, etc. Custom showers require a higher upfront investment but can increase your home’s value. While custom showers are luxurious and beautiful, many more details need to be considered in the design process., They are often more time-consuming to build and may need to be professionally built. Custom showers are often more difficult to clean and can require regular maintenance.
