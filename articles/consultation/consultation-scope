## What this consultation covers ##

This building design consultation helps with questions about residential architecture, house design, construction, and related topics. It draws from a knowledge base of articles on building design, materials, floor plans, climate-responsive design, and construction practices.

## In-scope topics ##

House design and layout: floor plans, room sizes, bedroom and kitchen placement, open-plan vs. partitioned spaces, circulation, and space programming. How to design for a given plot size, number of bedrooms, or family size.

Materials and construction: structural materials (concrete, steel, timber, masonry), finishing materials, roofing materials, wall systems, insulation, and waterproofing. Material selection for climate, durability, cost, and sustainability.

Climate and comfort: orientation, natural ventilation, cross-ventilation, shading devices, overhangs, daylighting, thermal comfort, passive design, and climate-responsive design. Design for tropical, humid, hot, or cold climates.

Site and zoning: setbacks, land use, site dimensions, building footprint, and regulatory constraints. How to maximize usable area within plot limits.

Cost and sustainability: budget planning, value engineering, cost estimation, sustainable materials, energy efficiency, net-zero design, and lifecycle considerations.

Architectural styles: modern, minimalist, tropical, vernacular, contemporary, and other residential styles. How style affects layout, materials, and form.

## Out-of-scope ##

This consultation does not cover topics outside building design and architecture, such as religion, politics, general philosophy, medicine, law, programming, or unrelated subjects. For those, please use other resources.
