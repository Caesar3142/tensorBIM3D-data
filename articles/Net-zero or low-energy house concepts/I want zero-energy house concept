## I want zero-energy house concept ##

A zero-energy house concept is designed to produce as much energy as it consumes over the course of a year by combining aggressive energy reduction strategies with on-site renewable generation. The design should begin with a highly efficient building envelope, including proper orientation, excellent roof and wall insulation, airtight construction, and high-performance windows to minimize heating and cooling loads. Passive design strategies such as cross-ventilation, stack ventilation, deep shading, and thermal mass help reduce reliance on mechanical systems. Energy-efficient LED lighting, inverter appliances, and smart energy management systems further lower electricity demand. Rooftop solar panels sized according to annual energy consumption, paired with grid-tied systems or battery storage, provide renewable power. Water-saving fixtures and rainwater harvesting can complement the sustainability strategy. By first minimizing energy demand and then offsetting the remaining consumption with renewable energy, the house can achieve net-zero energy performance while remaining comfortable and practical.
