## Design cost-efficient roof system ##

To design a cost-efficient roof system, choose a simple roof geometry such as a basic gable or single-slope (shed) roof to minimize structural complexity, material waste, and labor time. Avoid multiple valleys, hips, or complex intersections, as they increase framing and waterproofing costs. Use lightweight metal roofing sheets with proper anti-corrosion coating, as they are affordable, durable, and quick to install. Pair the roof with a simple steel or timber truss system designed on a regular grid to reduce fabrication waste. Ensure adequate roof pitch for proper drainage to prevent leakage and long-term maintenance costs. Invest in proper insulation beneath the roof to reduce heat gain and lower future cooling expenses. Wide but moderate overhangs can protect walls from rain without significantly increasing structural load. By prioritizing simplicity, standardization, and durable materials, you can achieve a roof system that is affordable to build and economical to maintain.
