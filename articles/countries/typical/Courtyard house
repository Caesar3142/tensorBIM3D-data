A courtyard house is a residential building design organized around a central open-air space known as a courtyard, which serves as the focal point of the home and provides natural light, ventilation, privacy, and a strong connection between indoor and outdoor living areas. The main defining characteristic of a courtyard house is that the rooms and living spaces are arranged along the perimeter of the central courtyard, forming a U-shaped, L-shaped, or fully enclosed rectangular layout that surrounds the open space. This courtyard is typically located at the center of the house, although in some designs it may be positioned toward the rear or side, depending on the size of the property and the architectural intent. The courtyard may be open to the sky or partially covered and is often used as a private outdoor area for relaxation, gardening, dining, or social gatherings.

The entrance to a courtyard house usually leads either directly into the courtyard or into a transitional indoor space such as a hallway or foyer that then opens into the courtyard, creating a gradual transition from the public exterior environment to the private interior environment. This arrangement enhances privacy by limiting direct views into the interior rooms from outside the property. The courtyard itself often includes landscaping elements such as plants, trees, grass, stone paving, water features, or seating areas, which contribute to a calm and comfortable atmosphere while improving environmental performance by cooling the surrounding air and promoting natural airflow throughout the house.

The interior layout of a courtyard house typically includes common living spaces such as the living room, dining room, and kitchen positioned along one or more sides of the courtyard, with doors, windows, or sliding glass panels that open directly into the courtyard. This design allows natural light to enter the rooms from both the exterior walls and the courtyard-facing walls, improving brightness and reducing the need for artificial lighting during the day. Bedrooms are usually located along quieter sides of the courtyard to provide privacy and comfort, while bathrooms, storage rooms, and utility spaces are positioned in convenient but less prominent locations. Circulation within the house often occurs along corridors, covered walkways, or open galleries that face the courtyard, allowing occupants to move between rooms while maintaining visual and physical connection to the central outdoor space.

One of the key advantages of the courtyard house design is its ability to provide excellent natural ventilation and thermal comfort, especially in warm or hot climates. The courtyard acts as a microclimate modifier, allowing hot air to rise and escape while drawing cooler air through the surrounding rooms, which helps regulate indoor temperatures without relying heavily on mechanical cooling systems. Thick exterior walls and shaded courtyard areas further enhance thermal performance by reducing heat gain from direct sunlight. In addition, the courtyard provides a secure and private outdoor space that can be used safely by occupants without exposure to public streets or neighboring properties.

Courtyard houses have been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, including ancient Roman domus houses, traditional Islamic homes in the Middle East, Spanish and Mediterranean houses, Chinese siheyuan courtyard residences, and Latin American colonial homes. In these cultures, the courtyard served not only environmental and functional purposes but also social and cultural roles, acting as a gathering place for family activities, ceremonies, and daily life. Modern courtyard houses continue to use the same fundamental concept while incorporating contemporary materials, larger glass openings, and modern amenities to improve comfort and aesthetics.

In larger courtyard houses, there may be multiple courtyards serving different purposes, such as a formal entrance courtyard, a private family courtyard, or a service courtyard used for laundry or utilities. Garages, storage rooms, and service areas are typically located at the perimeter of the house, with controlled access to maintain the privacy and integrity of the central courtyard. The courtyard itself often becomes the visual and functional heart of the home, visible from many interior rooms and serving as a natural extension of the indoor living space.

Overall, the courtyard house design emphasizes privacy, natural light, ventilation, and a harmonious relationship between indoor and outdoor environments. By organizing the house around a central open space, this layout creates a comfortable, secure, and environmentally responsive living environment that is well suited to a wide range of climates and cultural contexts, making it one of the oldest and most enduring residential design concepts in architectural history.
