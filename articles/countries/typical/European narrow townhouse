A European narrow townhouse is a multi-level residential building designed with a tall and slender footprint, typically constructed on narrow plots of land in densely populated urban areas where land availability is limited and expensive. This type of house is commonly found in historic city centers across countries such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, and Italy, where urban development evolved over centuries and buildings were constructed closely side by side along streets. The defining characteristic of a narrow townhouse is its vertical layout, where the house extends upward across two, three, or sometimes four or more floors rather than spreading horizontally. The width of the house is usually limited, often ranging from approximately 3 to 7 meters, while the depth may extend much further, creating a long and narrow interior configuration.

The exterior of a European narrow townhouse typically features a street-facing façade that is vertically proportioned, often with evenly spaced windows aligned across multiple floors. The façade may be constructed from brick, stone, plaster, or stucco, depending on the region and historical period, and often includes architectural details such as decorative trim, shutters, balconies, or ornamental moldings. The entrance door is usually located directly on the street and opens into a small entry hall or corridor that provides access to the interior spaces and staircase. Because the building shares side walls with neighboring houses, windows are usually limited to the front and rear façades, which makes efficient interior layout and vertical circulation especially important.

Inside the house, the layout is organized vertically, with each floor serving specific functions. The ground floor often contains the main entrance, hallway, and one or more functional spaces such as a living room, kitchen, dining room, or utility area. In some traditional designs, the kitchen may be located toward the rear of the ground floor with direct access to a small backyard, garden, or courtyard. The living room may be positioned at the front of the house, facing the street, with large windows that allow natural light to enter. In many historic townhouses, rooms on each floor are separated by solid walls and connected by a central staircase rather than open-plan layouts, reflecting traditional architectural practices.

The staircase is one of the most important elements in a narrow townhouse, as it provides vertical circulation between floors while occupying minimal space. Staircases are often designed in straight, spiral, or switchback configurations and are typically located along one side of the house or near the center. Upper floors usually contain bedrooms and bathrooms, arranged to maximize privacy and efficient use of space. Bedrooms may be located at the front or rear of the house, depending on light availability and noise considerations. Bathrooms are often positioned near the staircase or stacked vertically above each other to simplify plumbing systems.

Storage space in narrow townhouses may be more limited compared to larger suburban homes, and built-in closets are less common in older European buildings. Instead, residents often use freestanding wardrobes, cabinets, and shelving units for storage. In some houses, attics located beneath the roof provide additional storage space or may be converted into bedrooms, offices, or studio spaces. Similarly, basements are common in many European townhouses and are used for storage, laundry, mechanical systems, or additional functional areas.

Natural lighting and ventilation in narrow townhouses are carefully considered due to limited exterior wall exposure. Windows at the front and rear façades provide the primary source of daylight, and in some cases skylights or roof windows are added to improve lighting in upper levels. Some townhouses also include small internal courtyards, light wells, or rear gardens to bring additional light and air into the interior spaces. The rear of the house often opens to a small private outdoor area that can be used for gardening, seating, or utility purposes.

Modern European narrow townhouses may incorporate contemporary design features such as open-plan living areas, larger windows, improved insulation, and modern mechanical systems while preserving the traditional narrow exterior form. Renovations often focus on improving interior openness, increasing natural light, and enhancing energy efficiency while maintaining the historical character of the building.

Overall, the European narrow townhouse design is defined by its vertical organization, efficient use of limited land, and strong relationship to the surrounding urban environment. This layout allows multiple functional spaces to be stacked within a compact footprint, providing practical and comfortable living arrangements in dense city settings while preserving valuable land and maintaining the continuous architectural character of historic streets.
