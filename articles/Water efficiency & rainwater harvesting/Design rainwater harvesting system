Designing a rainwater harvesting system involves four main components: collection, conveyance, filtration, storage, and distribution. The goal is to capture rain from the roof, filter it, store it safely, and reuse it for non-potable or treated potable purposes.

Start with the collection surface. The roof is the most practical catchment area. Metal roofing, tiles, or concrete roofs can all be used, but smooth, non-toxic surfaces are preferred because they produce cleaner runoff. The amount of water you can collect depends on roof area and annual rainfall. As a simple estimate, harvested water volume equals roof area multiplied by rainfall depth multiplied by a runoff coefficient, typically around 0.8 to account for losses.

For example, if the roof area is 100 m² and annual rainfall is 1500 mm (1.5 meters), the potential collection is approximately 100 × 1.5 × 0.8 = 120 cubic meters per year. That equals 120,000 liters annually.

Next is the conveyance system. Install gutters along roof edges with a slight slope to direct water toward downpipes. Gutters should be sized according to local rainfall intensity. Downpipes carry water to the storage tank. Include leaf guards or mesh screens at gutter inlets to prevent debris from entering.

Before water reaches the tank, install a first-flush diverter. This device discards the initial runoff during rainfall, which often contains dust, bird droppings, and contaminants from the roof surface. After the initial flush, cleaner water flows into the storage system.

Filtration is essential. A simple system may include a sediment filter or sand filter before the tank. For higher water quality, additional cartridge filters can be installed before distribution.

Storage tanks can be above ground or underground. Tank size depends on water demand and rainfall pattern. For a typical household using harvested rainwater for toilet flushing, irrigation, and cleaning, a 3000 to 5000 liter tank is common. In areas with longer dry seasons, larger storage capacity is recommended.

The tank should have an overflow pipe directed away from the foundation to prevent water accumulation near the building. It should also include a sealed cover to prevent mosquito breeding and contamination.

Distribution can be gravity-fed if the tank is elevated, or use a small pump if the tank is at ground level. The system can be connected to toilets, garden irrigation, or washing machines. If the water is intended for drinking, advanced filtration and disinfection such as UV treatment or chlorination are required.

Position the tank near the downpipes to reduce piping length. Ensure the foundation can support the weight of a full tank, as 1000 liters of water weighs approximately one metric ton.

In summary, a rainwater harvesting system includes roof collection, properly sloped gutters, first-flush diversion, filtration, adequate storage, and safe distribution. Proper sizing based on roof area and rainfall ensures efficient water capture while reducing dependence on municipal supply.
