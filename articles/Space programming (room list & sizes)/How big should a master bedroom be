The size of a master bedroom depends on the level of comfort you want, how much furniture and storage it needs to accommodate, and the overall size of the house. In compact houses, the goal is not to make the master bedroom large, but to make it well proportioned and easy to use. A master bedroom should comfortably fit a bed, circulation space, storage, and still feel calm rather than crowded.

As a practical minimum, a master bedroom should be around 10 to 11 square meters if it only contains a bed and minimal storage. This size can work, but it will feel compact and requires careful furniture placement and built-in wardrobes. It is acceptable in very small urban houses, but it leaves little flexibility for additional furniture such as a desk or seating.

A more comfortable and commonly recommended size is around 12 to 14 square meters. At this size, a queen-size bed can be placed with clear circulation on both sides, along with a wardrobe and possibly a small dresser or desk. This range works very well for small to medium houses and provides a good balance between comfort and space efficiency. For most compact family homes, this is the ideal target.

If the master bedroom includes an ensuite bathroom, the bedroom itself does not need to be much larger, but the total master suite area will increase. An ensuite bathroom typically requires an additional 3 to 4 square meters if designed efficiently with a shower. In this case, a bedroom of around 12 square meters plus the ensuite works very well and avoids wasting space.

In houses where space is very tight, it is often better to slightly reduce bedroom size and invest more in ceiling height, window placement, and layout quality. A well-lit, well-ventilated 12 square meter bedroom with good proportions will feel more comfortable than a larger but poorly lit room. Window placement, views, and airflow play a major role in perceived comfort.

Furniture layout should guide the final size decision. A typical queen-size bed is about 1.6 by 2.0 meters. You ideally want at least 700 to 900 mm of clearance on the sides and foot of the bed for comfortable movement. Built-in wardrobes with sliding doors are usually more space-efficient than freestanding units and help keep the room visually calm.

In summary, for most houses, a good master bedroom size is around 12 to 14 square meters, excluding the bathroom. This size provides enough comfort without consuming too much of the overall floor area, which is especially important in compact homes. With good light, ventilation, and thoughtful furniture planning, even a modestly sized master bedroom can feel generous and restful.
