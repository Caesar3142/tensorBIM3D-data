Needing 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms is very achievable even with a small footprint, but it requires a clear strategy and disciplined space planning. The key decision is to go vertical and to clearly separate shared and private functions so that no space is wasted on unnecessary circulation.

With a maximum footprint of around 60 m², a two-storey house is the most practical solution. This gives you roughly 120 m² of total floor area, which is sufficient for 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms if rooms are sized efficiently. Trying to fit this program into a single storey would almost always result in cramped rooms, poor ventilation, or excessive corridors.

A very effective layout is to place shared spaces on the ground floor and private spaces on the upper floor. On the ground floor, you can accommodate an open-plan living, dining, and kitchen area, one bathroom, and possibly one bedroom. This ground-floor bedroom can work as a guest room, home office, or bedroom for elderly family members. Keeping this floor open and flexible helps the house feel larger than it is.

The upper floor can then contain the remaining two bedrooms and the second bathroom. One bedroom can function as the master bedroom, while the other serves as a children’s bedroom. Bedrooms do not need to be large; a comfortable size is typically around 9–11 m² for secondary bedrooms and 11–13 m² for the master bedroom if storage is built in. The shared bathroom upstairs should be placed directly above the ground-floor bathroom to simplify plumbing and reduce construction cost.

Bathroom size and layout are critical. Each bathroom should be compact but functional, typically around 3–4 m². Using showers instead of bathtubs saves space and works well in small houses. Sliding doors or pocket doors can further reduce space loss. Ventilation is essential, so each bathroom should have either a window to the outside or mechanical exhaust if a window is not possible.

Stair placement must be handled carefully, as it consumes space on both floors. A straight-run or compact U-shaped stair placed along one side of the house is usually the most efficient option. The space under the stairs should be fully utilized for storage, laundry, or shelving to avoid wasted volume.

Natural light and ventilation become especially important with three bedrooms. Ideally, every bedroom should have at least one external window. If the site is narrow or attached on both sides, a small rear yard, side setback, or light well can make a major difference. Even a modest courtyard or vertical void can ensure that bedrooms remain bright, airy, and comfortable.

In summary, a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom house is very realistic on a small footprint if the house is two storeys, the layout is compact, bathrooms are stacked, circulation is minimized, and storage is built in rather than added later. With careful planning, the house can meet all functional needs while still feeling comfortable, efficient, and livable rather than tight or compromised.
