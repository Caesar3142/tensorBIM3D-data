## I need a home office near entrance but still private ##

To create a home office near the entrance while maintaining privacy, position the office at the front of the house but separate it from the main living areas with a solid wall and a proper door rather than leaving it fully open. A small foyer or entry buffer can be placed between the front door and the office to prevent direct visibility from outside. Using frosted glass panels, vertical slats, or a partition wall can allow natural light in while still blocking clear sightlines. The office should have its own window for ventilation and daylight, and ideally be slightly offset from the main circulation path so visitors do not walk through family areas. Acoustic insulation in the walls and a solid-core door will further enhance privacy, making the workspace quiet and professional while remaining conveniently accessible from the entrance.
