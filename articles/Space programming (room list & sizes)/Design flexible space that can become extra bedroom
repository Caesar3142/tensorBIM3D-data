## Design flexible space that can become extra bedroom ##

To design a flexible space that can become an extra bedroom, position it near a bathroom and along a circulation path where it can function as a study, family room, or guest area during normal use. The room should have at least one full-height window for natural light and ventilation, and a minimum size of around 2.7 × 3 meters to comfortably fit a single or small double bed when needed. Use sliding, pocket, or folding partitions instead of fixed walls so the space can open up to the living area or close off for privacy. Built-in storage or a wall bed (Murphy bed) can allow quick transformation without clutter. Ensure the room has proper door access rather than relying solely on open-plan connectivity, so it qualifies functionally as a bedroom when required. By planning electrical outlets, lighting, and wardrobe niches in advance, the space can transition smoothly between everyday use and private sleeping accommodation.
