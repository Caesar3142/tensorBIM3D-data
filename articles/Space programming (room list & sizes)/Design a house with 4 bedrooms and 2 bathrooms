A practical way to design a 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom house is to clearly separate the public areas from the private sleeping zone while keeping circulation efficient and minimizing wasted hallway space. The layout below assumes a single-storey house of around 110–140 m² building area, which is comfortable for a family of four to six.

When entering the house, you step into a living room positioned at the front. This space can be moderately sized, around 3.5 × 4 meters, with large windows facing the front yard for natural light. The living room connects directly to the dining area, creating a semi-open layout that feels spacious. The dining area can be placed centrally in the house so it acts as a transition between the front living space and the kitchen behind it.

The kitchen is best located toward the rear of the house. An L-shaped or U-shaped kitchen layout works well for family use, providing enough countertop and storage space. Ideally, the kitchen has a door or sliding glass access to a backyard or service area for laundry and ventilation. If desired, a small pantry can be placed adjacent to the kitchen.

For the bedrooms, grouping them in one private wing improves privacy and noise control. The master bedroom should be positioned at the back corner of the house for maximum quietness. It can measure around 3.5 × 3.5 meters and include built-in wardrobes. This bedroom connects to a private bathroom, which can be around 1.5 × 2.5 meters or slightly larger, including a shower, toilet, and sink.

The remaining three bedrooms can be arranged along a short hallway. Each can be approximately 2.7 × 3 meters, suitable for children, guests, or use as a home office. These rooms share the second bathroom, which is ideally placed centrally between them for easy access. The shared bathroom can be around 1.5 × 2.5 meters. Positioning bathrooms back-to-back or close together reduces plumbing complexity and construction cost.

To avoid long corridors, you can design the layout so that the dining area opens into a short internal hall leading to the bedrooms. This keeps circulation compact and efficient. Each bedroom should have at least one window facing the side yard, backyard, or front yard to ensure natural light and airflow.

If space allows, you can also add a small storage room or built-in cabinets along the hallway. A laundry area can be placed at the back near the kitchen with direct outdoor access.

Overall, the design concept focuses on three zones: a public zone at the front with living and dining areas, a semi-private service zone with kitchen and laundry at the rear, and a private bedroom wing containing four bedrooms and two bathrooms. This arrangement provides comfort, privacy, and efficient use of space for a family home.
