On a 10 m × 15 m lot (150 m²), you have more flexibility compared to narrower plots, so the key is to organize the layout with clear zoning: public areas at the front, semi-private in the middle, and private rooms toward the back. A practical approach is to use around 90–110 m² for the building footprint and leave the rest for front setback, carport, side ventilation, and a small backyard.

At the front of the lot, allocate 3–4 meters depth for a carport and small garden. This improves natural lighting and privacy from the street. The main entrance can lead directly into the living room, which is positioned at the front corner of the house. The living room can face the front yard with a wide window to maximize daylight. If you prefer an open-plan concept, you can connect the living room directly to the dining area without partitions.

Behind the living area, place the dining space centrally. This works well as a transition zone between the public and more functional areas of the house. The kitchen can be positioned at the back of this open space. Locating the kitchen near the rear boundary allows direct access to a small backyard for laundry, service, and ventilation. If the lot width allows, you can maintain a 1–1.5 meter side setback on one side of the house to improve cross ventilation and window placement.

For bedrooms, a common and efficient arrangement is to place them along one side of the house connected by a short corridor. The master bedroom is best located at the back for privacy and quietness, possibly with its own small bathroom if space allows. The second and third bedrooms can be placed in the middle section of the house, each with windows facing the side setback or backyard. Keeping the bedrooms grouped together creates a clear private zone separated from the living areas.

The shared bathroom can be placed centrally between bedrooms for efficient plumbing and easy access. Positioning bathrooms against an exterior wall simplifies ventilation. If you want an additional guest toilet, it can be placed near the living area but discreetly tucked beside a hallway.

Circulation should be compact and direct. Avoid long hallways; instead, let the dining area or a small internal hall act as the connector to bedrooms. This minimizes wasted space and maximizes usable room area.

Overall, a balanced arrangement for a 10 m × 15 m lot is front zone for living and guest interaction, middle zone for dining and kitchen, and rear zone for bedrooms. With proper setbacks on at least one side and the rear, you ensure good airflow, natural lighting, and long-term comfort. If you want, I can also suggest a specific layout based on single-storey or double-storey preference.
