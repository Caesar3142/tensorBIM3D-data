A compact 60 m² house works best with a simple rectangular footprint and minimal internal circulation. The goal is to reduce hallway space, combine functions where possible, and ensure every room has access to natural light and ventilation. A practical total building size could be around 6 × 10 meters or 5 × 12 meters.

When entering the house, you step directly into an open-plan living, dining, and kitchen area. This main space can occupy about 20–24 m², for example 3.5 × 6 meters. The living area is positioned at the front with a window facing outside. Behind it, place a small dining table for four. The kitchen can run along one wall in a straight-line layout or L-shape at the rear corner. Keeping the kitchen compact and against the wall saves space while maintaining functionality. Using the same flooring throughout this area helps the house feel larger.

For a two-bedroom layout, position the bedrooms along one side of the house, accessed from a short internal passage branching from the main living space. The master bedroom can be about 3 × 3 meters, fitting a double bed and wardrobe. The second bedroom can be about 2.5 × 2.7 meters, suitable for a child’s room, guest room, or small office. Both bedrooms should have windows facing either the side yard or backyard.

The bathroom can be placed between or near the bedrooms for efficient plumbing. A size of about 1.5 × 2.2 meters is sufficient for a shower, toilet, and sink. Locating the bathroom along an exterior wall allows for a window for ventilation. If that is not possible, install a proper exhaust system.

To improve spatial efficiency, avoid long corridors. The dining area can act as a distribution point to the bedrooms and bathroom. Sliding doors can be used instead of swing doors in tight spaces to save clearance area.

If possible, allocate a small outdoor space at the back for laundry and airflow. Even a 1.5-meter deep service yard makes a big difference in comfort and ventilation. Large front windows and rear openings help create cross ventilation, which is important in compact homes.

Overall, a 60 m² house can comfortably include two bedrooms, one bathroom, and an open living-dining-kitchen area if the layout is simple, compact, and carefully proportioned. Proper zoning and minimal circulation are the key to making the space feel functional rather than cramped.
