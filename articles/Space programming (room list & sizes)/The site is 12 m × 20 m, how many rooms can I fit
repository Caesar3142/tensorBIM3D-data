On a 12 m × 20 m site, the number of rooms you can fit depends heavily on how much of the land is buildable, how many floors you plan to construct, and what you define as a “room.” Before counting rooms, it is important to consider setbacks, building coverage limits, and circulation space, because these factors reduce the net usable area significantly compared to the gross site area of 240 m².

If we assume a typical urban condition with modest setbacks, you might realistically build on about 60–70% of the site footprint. That gives a ground-floor building area of roughly 145–170 m². From this area, circulation elements such as stairs, corridors, and walls usually consume around 15–25%, leaving about 110–135 m² of net usable space per floor. This net area is what actually gets divided into rooms.

For a single-storey building, 110–135 m² can comfortably accommodate around 4 to 6 functional rooms, depending on room size and layout efficiency. For example, you could fit a living room, kitchen/dining area, two bedrooms, one bathroom, and possibly a small study or storage room. If rooms are kept compact and some spaces are combined, such as an open-plan living–dining–kitchen area, the number of distinct rooms can increase, but privacy and comfort may be reduced.

If the building is two storeys, the total usable floor area doubles, making a significant difference. With roughly 220–270 m² of net usable space across both floors, you could typically fit 8 to 12 rooms. A common arrangement would be shared living spaces and one bedroom on the ground floor, with three to four bedrooms and additional bathrooms on the upper floor. At this scale, room sizes can remain comfortable without forcing extreme compactness.

For a three-storey building, which is often used on narrow urban sites, the total usable area could reach 330–400 m². In this case, fitting 12 to 18 rooms becomes realistic. This could include multiple bedrooms, several bathrooms, living and family rooms, a kitchen and dining area, storage spaces, and possibly a home office or service room. The key limitation at this point is not floor area but vertical circulation efficiency, since stairs will occupy a fixed footprint on every level.

Room size assumptions matter greatly. A typical bedroom usually requires 9–12 m², a living room 18–25 m², a kitchen 8–12 m², and a bathroom 3–5 m². If you reduce room sizes below these ranges, you can technically fit more rooms, but usability, ventilation, and furniture layout quickly become problematic. Conversely, larger rooms reduce the total count but improve comfort and long-term livability.

In summary, on a 12 m × 20 m site, you can roughly expect 4–6 rooms on one floor, 8–12 rooms on two floors, and 12–18 rooms on three floors, assuming efficient planning and typical residential room sizes. The final number depends less on the site dimensions themselves and more on how efficiently circulation is handled, how compact you are willing to make individual rooms, and whether you prioritize room count or overall quality of space.
