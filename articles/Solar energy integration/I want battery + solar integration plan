## I want battery + solar integration plan ##

A battery and solar integration plan should begin by first calculating your average daily electricity consumption to properly size the solar array and battery capacity. Install rooftop solar panels on the section with the best sun exposure and minimal shading, and connect them to a hybrid inverter that can manage power flow between the panels, the home, the battery, and the grid. During the day, solar energy should prioritize powering household loads, with excess electricity stored in the battery for nighttime use. The battery capacity should ideally cover essential loads such as lighting, refrigeration, internet, and selected cooling systems for several hours in case of grid outages. Critical circuits can be separated into a backup subpanel to ensure efficient energy allocation. Proper ventilation and a protected indoor location are important for battery safety and longevity. Smart energy monitoring systems can optimize charging cycles, reduce peak-hour grid usage, and maximize self-consumption, helping lower electricity bills while improving energy resilience.
