## Optimize roof angle for solar energy ##

To optimize roof angle for solar energy, set the roof pitch close to your geographic latitude, as this generally maximizes annual solar exposure. For example, if you live at 10° latitude, a tilt of around 10–15° is typically efficient; at 30° latitude, aim for about 25–35°. In tropical regions near the equator, a lower tilt angle (10–15°) works well, while higher latitudes benefit from steeper angles to capture lower winter sun. If your goal is maximizing yearly production, match the tilt to latitude; if prioritizing winter generation, increase the tilt slightly above latitude; for summer optimization, reduce it slightly. Panels should face true south in the northern hemisphere and true north in the southern hemisphere, with minimal shading. On flat roofs, adjustable mounting frames allow ideal tilt without changing the structural roof slope, while also improving airflow beneath panels for better efficiency.
