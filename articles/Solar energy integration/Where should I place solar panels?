## Where should I place solar panels? ##

Solar panels should be placed on the roof area that receives the most consistent, unobstructed sunlight throughout the day. In most tropical and equatorial regions, the best orientation is facing south or slightly southwest, while in the northern hemisphere (outside the tropics), panels typically perform best facing true south, and in the southern hemisphere, facing true north. Avoid shading from trees, neighboring buildings, water tanks, or roof structures, as even partial shade can significantly reduce performance. Install panels on the section of the roof with the largest continuous surface area and minimal penetrations such as vents or skylights. A tilt angle close to the local latitude generally maximizes annual energy production, though in flat-roof houses, panels can be mounted on adjustable frames to optimize angle and airflow underneath for cooling efficiency. Proper spacing for maintenance access and good ventilation beneath the panels will also improve long-term performance and durability.
