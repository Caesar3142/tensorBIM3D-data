## Luxury bathroom design ##

Luxury bathroom design focuses on creating a high-end, comfortable, and visually striking space using premium materials, advanced fixtures, and thoughtful layouts. Features often include freestanding bathtubs, walk-in showers with multiple jets, double vanities, and high-quality finishes such as natural stone, marble, or custom tiles. Lighting is layered, combining ambient, task, and accent lights to enhance mood and highlight design elements. Spacious layouts, built-in storage, smart toilets, and integrated technology add convenience and comfort. Accessories and hardware are carefully selected for style and durability, while attention to ventilation, waterproofing, and ergonomics ensures both luxury and functionality in the bathroom.
