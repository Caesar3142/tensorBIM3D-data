## Building code compliance ##

Bathroom building code compliance ensures that the design, construction, and installation of fixtures, plumbing, electrical systems, and accessibility features meet local regulations for safety, health, and usability. Codes typically specify minimum clearances around toilets, sinks, and showers, proper venting and drainage, water supply pipe sizing, floor slopes for drainage, waterproofing requirements, electrical safety including GFCI outlets and lighting, and ventilation standards. Accessibility codes may require features such as grab bars, minimum turning radius, and barrier-free entries. Adhering to building codes helps prevent accidents, water damage, and legal issues, while ensuring the bathroom is safe, functional, and suitable for all users.
