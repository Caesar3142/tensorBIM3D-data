## Vanity lighting ##

Vanity lighting in a bathroom is designed to provide adequate illumination for tasks such as shaving, applying makeup, and grooming. Lights are typically installed around or above the mirror to minimize shadows on the face. Options include wall-mounted sconces on either side of the mirror, horizontal light bars above the mirror, or integrated LED mirrors. The lighting should have sufficient brightness and a color temperature that approximates natural daylight, usually around 3000–4000 Kelvin, to render colors accurately. Proper placement and diffusion help reduce glare, create an even light distribution, and enhance both functionality and aesthetics in the bathroom.
