## Shower area planning ##

Shower area planning involves designing a space that is safe, functional, and comfortable while effectively managing water flow. Key considerations include selecting an appropriate location within the wet zone, providing adequate space—typically at least 36 inches by 36 inches (about 91 cm by 91 cm)—and ensuring proper drainage with a slight floor slope toward the drain. Installing waterproof materials on walls and floors, such as tiles or moisture-resistant panels, is essential, along with using non-slip flooring to reduce accident risks. Shower enclosures or glass partitions help contain water and separate the wet zone from the dry zone. Additional factors include placement of fixtures like showerheads and controls for accessibility, sufficient lighting and ventilation to prevent mold, and optional storage niches for toiletries.
