## Tile joint sealing ##

Tile joint sealing in a bathroom involves filling the gaps between tiles with grout and then applying a sealant to prevent water penetration, mold, and staining. After tiles are installed, joints are filled with grout—cement-based, epoxy, or urethane—depending on the application and water exposure. Once the grout cures, a penetrating or surface sealant is applied to enhance water resistance, especially in wet zones like showers, bathtub surrounds, and floors. Proper sealing at corners, edges, and around fixtures, combined with regular maintenance, ensures that water does not seep behind tiles, protecting the underlying structure and prolonging the durability and hygiene of the tiled surfaces.
