## Toilet types ##

Toilet types vary based on design, installation method, and flushing mechanism. The most common types include close-coupled toilets, where the cistern sits directly on the bowl; wall-mounted toilets, which are suspended from the wall with concealed cisterns; and one-piece toilets, which combine the tank and bowl into a single unit for easier cleaning. There are also two-piece toilets with separate tank and bowl, pedestal toilets with exposed plumbing, and squat toilets, which are floor-mounted and require a squatting position. Flushing mechanisms can be gravity-fed, pressure-assisted, or dual-flush, offering different water efficiency levels. Each type is chosen based on space, aesthetics, water usage, and maintenance considerations.
