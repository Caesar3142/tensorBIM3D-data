## Cross ventilation ##

Cross ventilation in a bathroom uses the flow of air between two openings, such as windows or vents on opposite walls, to remove humidity, odors, and heat. Fresh air enters through one opening and pushes stale or moist air out through the other, creating a natural airflow that helps keep the space dry and comfortable. Effective cross ventilation requires properly sized and positioned openings, unobstructed paths for air movement, and consideration of prevailing wind directions. This method reduces reliance on mechanical fans, minimizes condensation and mold growth, and enhances overall indoor air quality.
