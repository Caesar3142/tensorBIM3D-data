## Washbasin types ##

Washbasin types vary in design, installation, and functionality to suit different bathroom layouts. Common types include pedestal basins, which rest on a column and conceal plumbing; wall-mounted basins, attached directly to the wall and ideal for small spaces; countertop or vessel basins, which sit on top of a vanity or counter for a stylish appearance; and under-mount basins, installed beneath the countertop for a seamless look. Other types include corner basins to save space, semi-recessed basins that partially extend into the countertop, and integrated basins, molded with the countertop for easy cleaning. Selection depends on available space, aesthetics, plumbing configuration, and ease of maintenance.
