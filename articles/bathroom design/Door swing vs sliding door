## Door swing vs sliding door ##

In bathroom design, door type significantly affects space efficiency and accessibility. A traditional swinging door requires clear floor space to open fully, which can limit layout options in smaller bathrooms or interfere with fixtures, but it provides a full seal for privacy and noise control. In contrast, a sliding door saves floor space because it moves along the wall rather than swinging, making it ideal for narrow or compact bathrooms. Sliding doors can be pocket-style, hiding inside the wall, or surface-mounted, running along the exterior. While they improve circulation and maximize usable space, sliding doors may offer slightly less sound insulation and require precise installation to ensure smooth operation and a proper seal.
