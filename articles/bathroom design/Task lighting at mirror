## Task lighting at mirror ##

Task lighting at the mirror in a bathroom is designed to provide focused illumination for activities such as shaving, applying makeup, or grooming. It is typically placed at eye level on either side of the mirror or above it to reduce shadows on the face. Fixtures can include wall-mounted sconces, LED strips, or lighted mirrors, and should have a color temperature close to natural daylight, around 3000–4000 Kelvin, for accurate color rendering. Proper placement and brightness ensure even light distribution, minimize glare, and enhance visibility, making daily tasks easier and more precise.
