## Seismic considerations ##

Seismic considerations in bathroom design focus on ensuring that fixtures, plumbing, and structural elements can withstand earthquake forces without failure or excessive damage. Plumbing pipes and connections should allow some flexibility to prevent leaks or breaks during ground movement, using flexible joints or slip couplings where possible. Heavy fixtures like bathtubs, showers, or vanities should be securely anchored to walls or floors to prevent tipping. Structural elements, including walls, slabs, and shafts, should be reinforced according to seismic codes, accounting for lateral and vertical loads. Proper placement of partitions, tiles, and glass panels, along with non-slip flooring, further enhances safety during seismic events, protecting both occupants and the integrity of the bathroom.
