## Concrete curing in wet areas ##

Concrete curing in wet areas, such as bathrooms, is the process of maintaining adequate moisture and temperature in newly poured concrete to achieve full strength and durability. Proper curing prevents cracking, shrinkage, and surface defects that could compromise waterproofing or tile adhesion. In wet areas, curing typically involves keeping the surface moist for at least 7 days using methods such as covering with wet burlap or plastic sheets, applying curing compounds, or continuous misting. Controlling temperature, avoiding rapid drying, and protecting the concrete from heavy water exposure during the initial curing period ensures a strong, stable substrate suitable for tiling, waterproofing, and long-term bathroom use.
