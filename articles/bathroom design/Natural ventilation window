## Natural ventilation window ##

A natural ventilation window in a bathroom allows fresh air to enter and humid air to escape, reducing moisture buildup, condensation, and the risk of mold growth. These windows are typically operable, such as casement, sliding, or awning styles, and are positioned to promote cross-ventilation if possible. Placement near showers, bathtubs, or sinks maximizes their effectiveness in wet zones. Using frosted or textured glass maintains privacy while allowing airflow and natural light. Proper sizing and operability ensure that the window provides sufficient air exchange to maintain a dry, comfortable, and healthy bathroom environment without relying solely on mechanical ventilation.
