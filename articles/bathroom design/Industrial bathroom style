## Industrial bathroom style ##

Industrial bathroom style emphasizes raw, utilitarian aesthetics inspired by warehouses or lofts. Common features include exposed pipes and ductwork, concrete or brick walls, and metal or black-finished fixtures. Flooring often uses concrete, large-format tiles, or textured surfaces, while sinks and vanities may incorporate reclaimed wood, steel, or stone for a rugged look. Lighting is typically bold and functional, such as pendant lights or exposed bulbs. Open layouts, minimal decoration, and a mix of metal, wood, and masonry elements create a functional, edgy, and modern space while maintaining durability and easy maintenance.
