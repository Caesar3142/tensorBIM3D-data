## Minimum ceiling height ##

Minimum ceiling height in a bathroom is typically specified by building codes to ensure comfort, safety, and proper ventilation. Most codes require a minimum clear height of 7 feet (about 2.13 meters) over the usable floor area. In shower or bathtub areas, some codes allow a slightly lower height, often around 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 meters), provided that fixtures and users have adequate clearance. Maintaining the minimum height helps ensure proper air circulation, allows safe installation of lighting and ventilation, and provides sufficient space for users to move comfortably.
