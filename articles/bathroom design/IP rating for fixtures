## IP rating for fixtures ##

IP rating for bathroom fixtures indicates the level of protection against solids and liquids, helping ensure safety and durability in wet environments. The IP (Ingress Protection) code consists of two digits: the first represents protection against solid objects like dust, and the second represents protection against water. For bathrooms, fixtures in general areas should have at least IP44, which protects against splashing water from any direction. Fixtures inside showers or wet zones often require higher ratings, such as IP65 or IP67, to withstand direct water jets or temporary immersion. Selecting the correct IP rating ensures electrical safety, prevents water damage, and prolongs the life of lighting and other electrical devices in the bathroom.
