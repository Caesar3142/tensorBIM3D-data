## Toilet clearance space ##

Toilet clearance space refers to the area around a toilet that ensures comfort, accessibility, and safety. Standard guidelines recommend at least 15 inches (38 cm) from the center of the toilet to any side wall or obstruction and 24 inches (61 cm) of clear space in front of the toilet for legroom and ease of use. These dimensions allow users to sit and stand comfortably, provide space for cleaning, and maintain proper circulation in the bathroom. For accessible or universal design, larger clearances are often required, such as 18–20 inches (46–51 cm) from the centerline to walls and 60 inches (152 cm) of clear floor space in front to accommodate wheelchair maneuverability.
