## Prefabricated bathroom pods ##

Prefabricated bathroom pods are complete, modular bathroom units manufactured off-site and delivered ready to install in a building. They typically include all fixtures, plumbing, electrical connections, and finishes within a self-contained module. This approach reduces on-site construction time, minimizes labor costs, and ensures consistent quality and waterproofing. Pods can be customized in size, layout, and materials to suit different building types, including hotels, apartments, and healthcare facilities. Installation involves connecting the pod to the building’s utilities, and careful planning of dimensions, access points, and structural support is essential to integrate the module seamlessly into the overall design.
