## Humidity control ##

Humidity control in bathrooms is essential to prevent mold, condensation, and damage to finishes. It can be achieved through proper ventilation using exhaust fans or operable windows that remove moist air and allow fresh air circulation. Heating the bathroom or using moisture-resistant materials such as tiles, waterproof paint, and sealed grout helps reduce condensation on surfaces. Monitoring humidity levels with hygrometers and keeping relative humidity below 60 percent can improve comfort and prevent mold growth. Regular maintenance of drains, waterproofing, and ventilation systems also ensures consistent humidity control and a healthier bathroom environment.
