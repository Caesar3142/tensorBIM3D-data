## Wet zone vs dry zone separation ##

In bathroom design, the wet zone refers to areas exposed to direct water flow, such as the shower or bathtub, while the dry zone includes spaces like the toilet, sink, and storage areas that are kept free from splashes. Separating these zones helps prevent water damage, reduces the risk of slips, and makes cleaning easier. This separation is often achieved through physical barriers like glass partitions, raised platforms, or waterproof flooring in the wet zone, ensuring that water stays contained while the dry zone remains functional and safe. Proper zoning also improves ventilation and maintains hygiene by limiting moisture buildup in areas with fixtures and storage.
