## Floor elevation difference ##

Floor elevation difference in a bathroom refers to the intentional change in height between different areas, often used to separate wet and dry zones. For example, the shower or wet area may be lowered slightly or the surrounding dry floor raised to create a step or curb, helping contain water and direct it toward drains. Typical elevation differences range from 1 to 3 inches, depending on floor slope requirements and drainage needs. Proper planning ensures safe transitions to prevent tripping, allows for effective waterproofing, and accommodates plumbing and structural requirements while maintaining a functional and visually appealing layout.
