## Minimum turning radius ##

Minimum turning radius in a bathroom refers to the circular space required for a person, including someone using a wheelchair, to make a 360-degree turn safely and comfortably. For accessible design, the typical minimum turning radius is about 60 inches (1.5 meters), providing enough space to maneuver around fixtures such as toilets, sinks, and bathtubs. In smaller or compact bathrooms, careful layout planning is needed to ensure that clearances and pathways meet this requirement while maintaining usability and compliance with accessibility standards.
