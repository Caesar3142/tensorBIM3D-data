## Elderly-friendly layout ##

An elderly-friendly bathroom layout focuses on safety, accessibility, and ease of use for older adults. Key features include wide, unobstructed pathways for mobility aids, curbless or low-threshold showers, and non-slip flooring throughout. Fixtures such as toilets and sinks are installed at comfortable heights, and grab bars are placed near toilets, showers, and bathtubs for stability. Adequate lighting, including night lights and task lighting near mirrors, enhances visibility, while lever-style faucets and easy-to-reach controls reduce strain. Clear separation of wet and dry zones, emergency access, and thoughtful storage placement help create a safe, functional, and comfortable bathroom for elderly users.
