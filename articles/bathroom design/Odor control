## Odor control ##

Odor control in bathrooms involves managing sources of unpleasant smells and ensuring proper ventilation to maintain a fresh environment. Effective strategies include installing exhaust fans to remove humid air and odors, keeping drains and traps filled with water to block sewer gases, and using tight-fitting lids on trash bins. Regular cleaning of toilets, sinks, and drains prevents buildup of bacteria that can cause odors. Some bathrooms incorporate activated carbon filters, air purifiers, or deodorizing systems to enhance air quality. Proper layout, separation of wet and dry zones, and routine maintenance of plumbing and ventilation systems also contribute to long-term odor control.
