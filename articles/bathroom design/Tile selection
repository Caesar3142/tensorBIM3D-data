## Tile selection ##

Tile selection in a bathroom involves choosing materials, sizes, textures, and finishes that balance aesthetics, durability, and safety. Common materials include ceramic, porcelain, natural stone, and glass, each offering different levels of water resistance, maintenance, and visual appeal. Floor tiles should have a non-slip surface to reduce the risk of accidents, while wall tiles can be smoother for easier cleaning. Color, pattern, and size influence the perception of space, with lighter colors making small bathrooms feel larger. Proper selection also considers compatibility with adhesives, grout, and waterproofing systems to ensure long-term performance and a cohesive, functional bathroom design.
