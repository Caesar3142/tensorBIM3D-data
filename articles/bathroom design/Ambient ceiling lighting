## Ambient ceiling lighting ##

Ambient ceiling lighting in a bathroom provides general illumination to make the space safe and comfortable to use. It is usually installed as recessed lights, flush-mount fixtures, or LED panels evenly distributed across the ceiling to avoid dark spots and shadows. The lighting should be bright enough to illuminate the entire room while creating a soft, uniform glow. Using moisture-rated or damp-location fixtures ensures safety in wet areas. Combining ambient ceiling lighting with task or accent lighting, such as vanity lights, enhances visibility and creates a balanced, functional, and visually appealing bathroom environment.
