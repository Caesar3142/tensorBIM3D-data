## Wall finishes ##

Wall finishes in bathrooms are chosen for durability, water resistance, and ease of maintenance. Common options include ceramic or porcelain tiles, which are highly water-resistant and available in various sizes, colors, and textures; natural stone, which offers a premium look but may require sealing; waterproof paint or moisture-resistant plaster for areas less exposed to direct water; and glass panels, which are easy to clean and modern in appearance. Finishes should be applied with proper waterproofing in wet zones, particularly around showers, bathtubs, and sinks, to protect underlying walls from moisture damage and mold growth while contributing to the overall aesthetic of the bathroom.
