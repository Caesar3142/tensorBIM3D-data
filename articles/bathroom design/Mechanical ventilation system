## Mechanical ventilation system ##

A mechanical ventilation system in a bathroom uses fans and ductwork to actively remove humid air, odors, and airborne contaminants, maintaining air quality and preventing mold growth. The system typically includes an exhaust fan, often ceiling-mounted near showers or wet zones, connected to ducts that discharge air outside the building. Some systems may incorporate supply fans or heat recovery ventilators to bring in fresh air and balance airflow. Proper sizing, measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM), ensures adequate air exchange based on bathroom size. Filters, dampers, and backdraft preventers may be included for efficiency and hygiene, while regular maintenance keeps the system operating effectively. Mechanical ventilation is especially important in bathrooms without operable windows or in high-humidity climates.
