## Switch placement ##

Switch placement in a bathroom is planned for safety, convenience, and accessibility. Switches for lights, fans, or other electrical devices are usually installed outside wet zones, at least a few feet away from showers, bathtubs, and sinks, to minimize the risk of electric shock. Standard height is typically around 42–48 inches from the floor, within easy reach for most users. In some cases, switches may be placed near the entrance or behind doors for convenient control, and using moisture-rated or low-voltage switches in damp areas adds an extra layer of safety. Proper placement ensures functionality while complying with electrical codes and maintaining a safe bathroom environment.
