## Lighting and Ventilation ##

Ensuring adequate lighting and ventilation is critical for a functional and safe shower. A shower with proper lighting can help it feel brighter while helping you see the shower area, reducing the risk of slipping. Proper lighting can also help you evaluate a material’s condition and see if it needs to be cleaned, if mold/mildew is occurring, if maintenance is needed, etc. Some common forms of shower lighting are recessed lights approved for shower locations (wet rated/vapor proof), combination exhaust fan with integrated light, and various wet rated LED lighting.  Other sources to consider can come from nearby lighting, a window, or a skylight.

International Residential Code (IRC) requires venting in a bathroom. This can be an operable window at least 3 square feet in area or a mechanical exhaust vent. Below is a general guideline for exhaust venting for various bathroom sizes.

Less than 50 sq ft: 50 CFM
50 – 100 sq ft: 1 CFM per sq ft of floor space
More than 100 sq ft: add 50 CFM for each fixture or 100 CFM for a jetted tub
Proper venting can help prolong the life of your bathroom and shower by removing excess humidity.  This will ultimately help prevent mold, mildew, and moisture damage and protect surfaces such as ceilings and paint.
