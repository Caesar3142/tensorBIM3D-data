## Water supply layout ##

A water supply layout in a bathroom involves planning the distribution of hot and cold water to all fixtures—sinks, toilets, showers, and bathtubs—while ensuring adequate pressure, flow rate, and accessibility for maintenance. Pipes are typically routed behind walls, under floors, or through ceilings, with a focus on minimizing bends and long runs to reduce pressure loss. Hot water lines may connect to a centralized heater or point-of-use heaters near fixtures for efficiency. Proper zoning separates wet and dry areas, and shut-off valves are installed at each fixture for safety and maintenance. Using durable, corrosion-resistant materials such as PEX, copper, or CPVC, along with well-planned pipe insulation, helps prevent leaks, maintain temperature, and ensure reliable operation over time.
