## Shaft structural planning ##

Shaft structural planning in a bathroom involves designing vertical spaces that house plumbing, ventilation, and sometimes electrical or mechanical systems without compromising the building’s structural integrity. The shaft must be positioned to align with wet zones, minimize pipe runs, and allow maintenance access, while maintaining adequate clearances for ducts, pipes, and insulation. Structural reinforcement, such as additional beams, columns, or wall thickness, is often required around the shaft to support loads interrupted by openings. Proper coordination with floor slabs, walls, and ceilings ensures that the shaft does not weaken the structure, while fireproofing, waterproofing, and vibration control enhance safety, durability, and functionality of the services within the bathroom.
