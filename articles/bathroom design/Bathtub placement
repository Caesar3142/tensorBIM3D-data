## Bathtub placement ##

Bathtub placement should balance functionality, aesthetics, and plumbing convenience. Ideally, it is positioned in the wet zone, near existing water supply and drainage lines to minimize costly plumbing work. Space around the bathtub should allow comfortable entry and exit, typically leaving at least 2 feet (60 cm) of clearance on one side. For built-in or alcove tubs, walls on three sides provide support and allow for tiled surrounds, while freestanding tubs benefit from being a focal point, often centered or offset in the room with enough circulation space. Proper waterproofing, slip-resistant flooring, and easy access to faucets and shower controls are essential, and consideration of natural or artificial lighting can enhance the bathing experience.
