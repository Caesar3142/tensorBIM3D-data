## Duct routing ##

Duct routing in a bathroom involves planning the path of ventilation ducts from exhaust fans or mechanical systems to the exterior of the building. The ducts should be as short and straight as possible to minimize airflow resistance and maintain efficient air extraction. Smooth, rigid ducts are preferred over flexible or corrugated ducts to reduce noise and friction. Ducts should avoid sharp bends and obstacles, and where bends are necessary, gradual turns help maintain airflow. Proper insulation may be required to prevent condensation inside the ducts, and all joints should be sealed to prevent leaks. Correct duct routing ensures effective removal of humid air, odors, and contaminants from the bathroom.
