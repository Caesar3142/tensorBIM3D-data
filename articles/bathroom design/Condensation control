## Condensation control ##

Condensation control in bathrooms involves reducing moisture accumulation on walls, ceilings, and surfaces to prevent mold growth and water damage. Effective strategies include installing proper ventilation, such as exhaust fans or operable windows, to remove humid air, and using heating or insulation to keep surfaces warm and reduce temperature differences that cause condensation. Moisture-resistant materials, like tiles and waterproof paint, help protect walls and ceilings, while keeping doors and windows slightly open after showers allows air circulation. Regular maintenance, such as wiping down wet surfaces and ensuring drains and waterproofing are functioning properly, also helps minimize condensation and maintain a dry, healthy bathroom environment.
