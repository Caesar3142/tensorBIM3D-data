## Leak testing methods ##

Leak testing methods in bathrooms are used to verify the integrity of plumbing and waterproofing systems before finishing surfaces. Common approaches include water testing, where pipes, drains, or wet areas are filled with water and observed for leaks over a set period, and air pressure testing, which involves pressurizing the plumbing system with air to detect drops in pressure that indicate leaks. For waterproofing, flood testing is often used, where the floor or shower area is temporarily filled with water to check for seepage into adjacent structures. Visual inspection, dye testing, and electronic moisture meters can also help identify leaks. Proper testing ensures that the plumbing and waterproofing systems are functioning correctly and prevents future water damage.
