## Waterproofing system ##

A waterproofing system in a bathroom is designed to prevent water from penetrating walls, floors, and structural elements, protecting the building from moisture damage, mold, and leaks. It typically involves applying a waterproof membrane or coating on wet zones, including shower floors, bathtub surrounds, and areas around sinks and toilets. Proper detailing includes sealing joints, corners, pipe penetrations, and edges, often with additional tapes or sealants. The floor is usually sloped toward drains to ensure water flows away efficiently. Materials used can include liquid-applied membranes, sheet membranes, cementitious coatings, or combination systems, and adherence to manufacturer guidelines and local building codes is essential for long-lasting protection and hygiene in the bathroom.
