## Standard vs custom cabinets ##

Standard cabinets in bathrooms are pre-manufactured units available in fixed sizes, styles, and finishes, making them cost-effective and easy to install. They are widely available, allow for quick replacement or upgrades, and typically come with standard storage configurations. Custom cabinets, in contrast, are designed and built to fit specific dimensions, layouts, and design preferences, offering more flexibility in style, materials, and functionality. They can maximize storage in unusual spaces and match the bathroom’s aesthetic precisely but are generally more expensive and require longer lead times for design and fabrication. The choice between standard and custom cabinets depends on budget, space constraints, and desired personalization.
