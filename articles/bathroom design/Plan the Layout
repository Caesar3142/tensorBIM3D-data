## Plan the Layout ##

Now that we have determined the shower type, location, size, walls, and fixtures, you are ready to plan the shower layout. The layout will be where the fixtures, features, and shower entrance are located within the shower.

While every shower layout will be unique and specific to your individual needs, there are some general tips for planning your shower layout to optimize your shower experience.

Position the showerhead away from the shower entry to minimize splashing to the outside.
Ensure the shower’s entry isn’t obstructed by doors, cabinets, or other fixtures. If your shower will have a door, make sure there is enough space for it to open to at least 90 degrees.
Position shower control knobs within easy reach of the shower entrance.  You should be able to turn on the shower without needing to step into the shower.
You can make plumbing easier to install and more cost-effective if there is an opportunity for the shower fixture wall to be shared with other walls that require water, such as sinks or toilets.
Plan for how you will access towels from within the shower.
If a window will be in the shower area, avoid placing the shower head where water may directly hit the window.
Position benches for minimal water exposure, ideally out of reach of a fixed shower head but within reach of a handheld shower head.
Position the drain away from the primary standing area for comfort.
If your shower will have recessed waterproof lighting, position the lights to minimize shadows for functionality and safety.
Install the exhaust fan near the shower to prevent humidity and mold, but not directly in the shower to avoid water damage.
