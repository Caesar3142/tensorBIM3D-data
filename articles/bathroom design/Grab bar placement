## Grab bar placement ##

Grab bar placement in a bathroom is critical for safety, particularly for preventing slips and falls in wet areas. Bars are typically installed near toilets, showers, and bathtubs at heights that allow easy support while sitting, standing, or transferring, usually between 33 and 36 inches from the floor. Horizontal bars provide stability along walls, vertical bars assist with entry and exit, and angled bars can support multiple motions. Proper anchoring into wall studs or using reinforced mounting ensures the bars can support significant weight, and placement should allow unobstructed use while maintaining comfort and accessibility for all users.
