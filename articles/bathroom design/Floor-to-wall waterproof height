## Floor-to-wall waterproof height ##

The floor-to-wall waterproof height in a bathroom is the distance up the walls that the waterproofing layer extends to protect against water damage. Typically, waterproofing extends at least 6 to 12 inches above the finished floor in general wet areas, while areas exposed directly to water, such as shower walls, bathtub surrounds, or behind sinks, often require waterproofing up to the full height of the shower or at least 72 inches from the floor. Proper detailing at corners, wall-to-floor junctions, and around pipe penetrations ensures a continuous barrier that protects both the building structure and interior finishes from moisture intrusion.
