## Vent pipe system ##

A vent pipe system in a bathroom is part of the plumbing network that allows air to enter the drainage pipes, preventing vacuum formation and ensuring smooth wastewater flow. Vent pipes connect to the main soil and waste lines and extend vertically through the roof or to an exterior vent, allowing sewer gases to escape safely while maintaining proper pressure in the pipes. This system prevents slow drainage, siphoning of water from trap seals, and odors from entering the bathroom. Typical layouts include individual vents for each fixture or a common vent serving multiple fixtures, with proper sizing and slope to ensure air movement and compliance with local plumbing codes.
