## Minimum bathroom size standards ##

Minimum bathroom size standards vary depending on local building codes and the type of bathroom, but generally, a full bathroom should have at least 5 feet by 8 feet (approximately 1.5 meters by 2.4 meters) to accommodate a toilet, sink, and bathtub or shower comfortably. A half bath or powder room typically requires a minimum of 3 feet by 6 feet (about 0.9 meters by 1.8 meters) for a toilet and sink. Clearances around fixtures are also important: at least 21 inches (53 cm) in front of the toilet, 30 inches (76 cm) width for passage, and 24 inches (61 cm) in front of the sink are generally recommended to ensure usability and accessibility. For universal or accessible design, larger dimensions may be needed to allow wheelchair maneuverability, usually a 5-foot turning radius.
