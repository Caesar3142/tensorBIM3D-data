## Non-slip tiles ##

Non-slip tiles in bathrooms are designed to reduce the risk of slips and falls by providing extra traction, especially in wet areas like showers, tubs, and around sinks. These tiles often have textured, matte, or patterned surfaces that increase friction, and their slip resistance is commonly measured using a coefficient of friction rating. Materials include ceramic, porcelain, natural stone, and vinyl, with smaller tiles or mosaic patterns also helping improve grip due to more grout lines. Proper installation, adequate floor slope for drainage, and regular cleaning are important to maintain their effectiveness and ensure safety in the bathroom.
