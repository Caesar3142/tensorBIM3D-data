## Water heater placement ##

Water heater placement in a bathroom or nearby utility area should prioritize safety, accessibility, and efficient plumbing. Heaters are typically installed on walls, ceilings, or in dedicated closets, keeping them away from direct wet zones to reduce the risk of electrical hazards. They should be positioned close to the main points of use, such as sinks, showers, or bathtubs, to minimize heat loss and reduce wait time for hot water. Adequate clearance around the unit is necessary for maintenance and inspection, and proper mounting or support is required for heavier models. Ventilation and, where applicable, pressure relief valves and drip pans should also be included to ensure safe operation.
