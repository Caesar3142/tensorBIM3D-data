## Determine Your Budget ##

A shower budget can vary greatly depending on the scope of work, labor, materials, features, and more. A simple shower retrofit could only be a few thousand dollars, whereas a large luxury shower might cost tens of thousands. Evaluating your finances and how much you can afford to spend on your shower project will help determine the extent of your shower design.

Ask contractors for examples of past projects to understand what shower design options are available and at what cost. Another option is to design your shower, get quotes from several contractors, and adjust your shower design based on the quotes.
