## Corner bathroom layout ##

A corner bathroom layout is designed to maximize space efficiency in smaller bathrooms or irregularly shaped rooms by placing fixtures along two adjoining walls. Typically, the toilet, sink, and shower or bathtub are arranged to fit snugly into the corners, freeing up central floor space for easier movement. Corner sinks and vanities help save room, while corner showers or compact tubs reduce the footprint of wet zones. Proper zoning between wet and dry areas is important, with barriers like glass partitions or half walls to contain water. Adequate clearance in front of each fixture, usually 24–30 inches (61–76 cm), ensures comfort, and careful planning of lighting, ventilation, and storage helps maintain functionality despite limited space.
