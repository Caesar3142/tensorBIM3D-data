## Where should I place the bathrooms? ##

Bathrooms should be placed where they are convenient to use, easy to ventilate, economical to build, and unobtrusive to daily living spaces. In a small or compact house, bathroom location is especially important because poor placement can waste space, increase construction cost, and reduce comfort.

The most important principle is to place bathrooms close to the rooms that use them. Bathrooms should be near bedrooms and sleeping areas, not far across the house. For a two-storey house with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, the most comfortable arrangement is one bathroom on the ground floor for guests and daily use, and one bathroom on the upper floor near the bedrooms. This avoids people moving through private areas and up or down stairs unnecessarily.

Bathrooms should ideally be stacked vertically. Placing the upper-floor bathroom directly above the ground-floor bathroom is one of the most cost-effective and reliable design decisions you can make. Stacked bathrooms share plumbing pipes, reduce floor penetrations, simplify maintenance, and minimize the risk of leaks. This approach also keeps service zones compact, freeing more space for living and bedrooms.

Ventilation strongly influences bathroom placement. Every bathroom should have access to natural ventilation if possible, either through an external wall, a side setback, a rear yard, or a light well. Bathrooms that open to a small courtyard or vertical ventilation shaft perform much better in terms of humidity control, odor removal, and long-term durability. If a bathroom must be internal, it should be paired with a strong mechanical exhaust and never placed in the center of the house without airflow planning.

Bathrooms should act as buffer spaces rather than prime rooms. They are best placed along less favorable orientations, such as west-facing walls, or between bedrooms and noisy areas. Using bathrooms, stairs, or storage as buffers helps protect living rooms and bedrooms from heat, noise, and unwanted views.

Avoid placing bathrooms directly next to the kitchen if possible, especially where walls are thin. While it is not structurally wrong, it often feels uncomfortable in daily use. If they must be close for plumbing reasons, ensure good sound insulation and clear separation of access so circulation paths do not conflict.

In compact houses, bathroom size should be modest and efficient. A well-designed bathroom of 3–4 m² with a shower works very well. Sliding or pocket doors save space and improve circulation. Locating bathrooms off short corridors or at the edge of living spaces prevents them from dominating main rooms.

For privacy, bathroom doors should never open directly into living or dining areas if it can be avoided. A short buffer space, such as a small hallway, wardrobe area, or change in direction, greatly improves comfort and perception, even in small houses.

In summary, place bathrooms near bedrooms, stack them vertically, give them access to natural ventilation, and use them as service or buffer zones rather than focal spaces. When bathrooms are planned early and placed logically, they disappear into the background of daily life, which is exactly what good bathroom placement should achieve.
