## Anti-scald valves ##

Anti-scald valves in bathrooms are devices installed in showers, tubs, and sinks to prevent sudden changes in water temperature that could cause burns. They work by regulating the mix of hot and cold water, maintaining a safe and consistent output even if water pressure fluctuates elsewhere in the plumbing system. Common types include thermostatic mixing valves, which automatically adjust the temperature, and pressure-balancing valves, which compensate for pressure drops. Proper installation near the fixture, along with compliance with local plumbing codes, ensures user safety, particularly for children, the elderly, or anyone sensitive to hot water.
