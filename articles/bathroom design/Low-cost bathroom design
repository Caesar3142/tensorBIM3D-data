## Low-cost bathroom design ##

A low-cost bathroom design focuses on functionality and durability while minimizing material and installation expenses. Key strategies include using standard-size ceramic or porcelain tiles, prefabricated or acrylic bathtubs, and basic wall-mounted or pedestal sinks. Compact layouts reduce the amount of plumbing and flooring required, and simple fixtures with standard finishes help keep costs down. Open showers or curtain enclosures can replace glass panels, and wall-mounted shelving or modular storage provides inexpensive organization. Efficient planning, such as grouping wet zones and minimizing complex tiling or custom cabinetry, ensures the bathroom remains practical, safe, and visually appealing while staying within budget.
