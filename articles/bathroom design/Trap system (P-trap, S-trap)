## Trap system (P-trap, S-trap) ##

A trap system in a bathroom is a plumbing feature designed to prevent sewer gases from entering living spaces while allowing wastewater to flow freely. The most common types are P-traps and S-traps. A P-trap has a U-shaped bend and is installed under sinks, bathtubs, and showers; it holds a small amount of water to create a seal against odors while connecting directly to a horizontal drain line. An S-trap, shaped like an S, is typically used where the waste pipe drops directly into the floor; it also holds water as a barrier but is less preferred in modern construction because it can siphon dry more easily, potentially breaking the water seal. Proper installation, correct sizing, and adequate venting are essential to maintain the water seal, ensure smooth drainage, and comply with plumbing codes.
