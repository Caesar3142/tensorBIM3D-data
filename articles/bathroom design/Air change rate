## Air change rate ##

Air change rate in a bathroom refers to the number of times the total volume of air in the room is replaced with fresh air within an hour. It is a key parameter for maintaining indoor air quality, controlling humidity, and preventing mold growth. Standard recommendations for bathrooms are typically 6 to 12 air changes per hour (ACH), depending on size and usage. Proper air change rates are achieved through adequately sized exhaust fans, ducting, and sometimes supplementary ventilation like windows or mechanical systems. Ensuring the correct rate helps remove moisture and odors efficiently, maintaining a comfortable and healthy bathroom environment.
