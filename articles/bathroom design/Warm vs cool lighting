## Warm vs cool lighting ##

Warm and cool lighting in bathrooms affect both ambiance and functionality. Warm lighting, with a color temperature around 2700–3000 Kelvin, produces a soft, yellowish glow that creates a cozy and relaxing atmosphere, often used for general or ambient lighting. Cool lighting, typically 4000–5000 Kelvin, emits a bright, white light that mimics daylight, enhancing visibility and color accuracy, making it ideal for task lighting around mirrors or for detailed grooming activities. Many bathrooms combine both types, using warm lighting for overall ambiance and cool lighting for focused tasks, balancing comfort and functionality.
