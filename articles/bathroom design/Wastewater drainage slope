## Wastewater drainage slope ##

Wastewater drainage slope is the gradual incline of pipes that allows wastewater to flow by gravity from bathroom fixtures to the main sewer or septic line. Proper slope prevents blockages and ensures efficient drainage: for small-diameter pipes (1½–2 inches or 38–50 mm), a slope of about ¼ inch per foot (2 %) is recommended, while larger pipes (3–4 inches or 75–100 mm) typically require 1/8 inch per foot (1 %). Too steep a slope can cause water to flow too quickly, leaving solids behind, while too shallow a slope can result in slow drainage and clogs. Maintaining a consistent slope along the entire run, avoiding abrupt bends, and using venting to allow air flow are essential for a reliable and hygienic bathroom drainage system.
