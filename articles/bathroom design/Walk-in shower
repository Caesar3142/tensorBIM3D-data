## Walk-in shower ##

A walk-in shower is an open or partially enclosed shower area that allows easy entry without the need for a raised threshold or bathtub. It often features a single glass panel or low curb to separate the wet zone from the rest of the bathroom while maintaining an open, spacious feel. Walk-in showers require proper floor slope toward a drain to prevent water pooling, waterproofing of floors and walls, and consideration of ventilation to reduce humidity. They can accommodate various fixtures, including overhead rain showers, handheld sprays, or body jets, and are popular for their accessibility, modern aesthetic, and ease of cleaning.
