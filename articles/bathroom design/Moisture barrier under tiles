## Moisture barrier under tiles ##

A moisture barrier under tiles is a protective layer installed between the subfloor and tile to prevent water from seeping into the structure and causing damage. It is commonly used in wet areas such as bathrooms, showers, and laundry rooms. Materials for moisture barriers include polyethylene sheets, liquid-applied membranes, or specialized underlayment boards. The barrier helps control water penetration, reduces the risk of mold and rot, and enhances the longevity of the tile installation. Proper overlap, sealing at seams, and extending the barrier slightly up the walls around wet zones ensure a continuous layer of protection beneath the tiles.
