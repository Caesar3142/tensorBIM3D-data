## Combined toilet and bath ##

A combined toilet and bath layout integrates the toilet, sink, and shower or bathtub within a single room, optimizing space in smaller homes or apartments. Proper planning separates the wet zone, containing the shower or bathtub, from the dry zone, where the toilet and sink are located, often using glass partitions, shower curtains, or half walls to contain water. Adequate clearances—typically 15 inches (38 cm) from the toilet center to side walls, 24 inches (61 cm) in front, and at least 36 inches by 36 inches (91 × 91 cm) for the shower or bathtub—ensure comfort and safety. Efficient fixture placement, ventilation, lighting, and storage solutions help maintain hygiene and usability, while waterproof materials and non-slip flooring protect the space from moisture damage.
