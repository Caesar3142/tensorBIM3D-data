## Drainage inspection ##

Drainage inspection in a bathroom involves checking the plumbing and floor systems to ensure wastewater flows efficiently and safely to the main sewer or septic system. The inspection typically includes verifying pipe slopes, proper connections, and secure joints to prevent leaks or blockages. Floor drains, shower drains, and toilet waste lines are tested, often with water or air pressure, to confirm they are clear and functioning properly. Venting systems are also checked to ensure proper airflow and prevent siphoning of traps. This inspection helps identify potential issues early, ensures compliance with plumbing codes, and prevents water damage, odors, or slow drainage in the bathroom.
