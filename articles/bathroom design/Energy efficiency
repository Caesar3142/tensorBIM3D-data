## Energy efficiency ##

Bathroom energy efficiency focuses on reducing energy consumption while maintaining comfort and functionality. Key strategies include installing low-flow faucets, showerheads, and dual-flush toilets to minimize water heating demands, using energy-efficient LED lighting, and incorporating timers or motion sensors for lights and exhaust fans. Insulating hot water pipes and choosing efficient water heaters, such as tankless or heat pump models, also reduce energy use. Natural ventilation and daylighting can supplement mechanical systems, and selecting durable, low-maintenance materials reduces the need for frequent replacements. Together, these measures lower utility costs, reduce environmental impact, and create a sustainable bathroom environment.
