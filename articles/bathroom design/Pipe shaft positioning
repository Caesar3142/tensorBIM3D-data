## Pipe shaft positioning ##

Pipe shaft positioning in a bathroom involves locating vertical or horizontal shafts that house plumbing, drainage, and sometimes electrical conduits, ensuring efficient distribution and maintenance access. Shafts are typically placed along walls, corners, or within partition walls to minimize interference with fixtures and circulation space. They should align with wet zones to reduce pipe runs and simplify connections to toilets, sinks, showers, and bathtubs. Adequate space inside the shaft allows for future repairs or upgrades, and access panels are often provided for cleaning and maintenance. Proper placement also considers ventilation, insulation of hot water pipes, and fire safety regulations to ensure the shaft does not compromise the bathroom’s functionality or safety.
