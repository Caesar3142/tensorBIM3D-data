## Slab drop for plumbing ##

Slab drop for plumbing refers to creating a lowered section in the bathroom floor to accommodate pipes and drainage lines without raising the surrounding floor level. This drop allows for proper slope in wastewater drainage, typically 1–2 percent toward floor drains, ensuring efficient flow and preventing blockages. It is often used in wet zones such as showers, bathtubs, or areas with multiple fixtures, and must be carefully coordinated with the structural slab to maintain strength and stability. Proper waterproofing, reinforcement, and accurate depth measurement are essential to protect the slab and surrounding areas from leaks, moisture damage, and structural issues.
