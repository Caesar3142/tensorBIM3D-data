## Ventilation code requirement ##

Bathroom ventilation code requirements specify the minimum airflow and methods to remove moisture and odors, ensuring air quality and preventing mold growth. Most building codes require either an operable window or a mechanical exhaust fan. When using a fan, the minimum ventilation rate is typically 50 cubic feet per minute (CFM) for intermittent use or 20 CFM for continuous operation, though larger bathrooms may require higher rates based on floor area or fixture count. Exhaust ducts must discharge to the exterior, not into attics or crawl spaces, and fans should be rated for damp locations. Compliance with these requirements helps maintain a safe, healthy, and code-approved bathroom environment.
