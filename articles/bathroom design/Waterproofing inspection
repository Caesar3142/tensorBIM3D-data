## Waterproofing inspection ##

Waterproofing inspection in a bathroom is a process to verify that all wet areas are properly protected against water penetration before tiling or finishing. The inspection typically includes checking the integrity and coverage of membranes, coatings, or liners on floors and walls, ensuring that corners, joints, pipe penetrations, and transitions are sealed correctly. Common testing methods include visual inspection, flood testing, or using moisture meters to detect leaks. Ensuring proper slope toward drains and continuity of the waterproofing layer is also part of the inspection. This step is critical to prevent leaks, mold growth, and structural damage, ensuring a durable and watertight bathroom.
