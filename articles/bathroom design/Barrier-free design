## Barrier-free design ##

Barrier-free design in a bathroom focuses on creating spaces that are accessible to all users, including those with mobility challenges, without the need for steps, thresholds, or obstacles. Features typically include curbless showers, wide doorways, and clear floor space for wheelchair maneuverability. Fixtures such as toilets, sinks, and grab bars are installed at accessible heights, and non-slip flooring and adequate lighting enhance safety. Proper placement of controls, faucets, and storage ensures usability, while maintaining wet and dry zone separation helps prevent slips. Barrier-free design promotes independence, safety, and comfort for users of all ages and abilities.
