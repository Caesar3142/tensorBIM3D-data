## Shower types ##

Shower types vary in design, installation, and functionality to suit different bathroom layouts and user preferences. Common types include **stall showers**, which are enclosed units often with sliding or hinged doors; **walk-in showers**, which have an open entry and no door or a partial glass partition for easy access; **corner showers**, designed to fit in limited spaces with angled or curved doors; **rain showers**, which use a large overhead fixture to mimic rainfall; **handheld showers**, which offer flexibility with a detachable spray head; and **tub-shower combos**, where a shower is installed over a bathtub for dual functionality. The choice depends on space, accessibility, aesthetics, and user needs.
