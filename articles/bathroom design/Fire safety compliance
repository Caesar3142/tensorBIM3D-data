## Fire safety compliance ##

Fire safety compliance in a bathroom ensures that materials, layouts, and installations minimize the risk of fire and allow safe evacuation if needed. Requirements typically include using fire-resistant materials for walls, ceilings, and flooring, proper sealing of openings around pipes and ducts, and maintaining clear access to exits. Electrical installations, such as lighting, outlets, and water heaters, must meet fire codes with proper circuit protection, grounding, and use of damp- or wet-rated fixtures. In multi-story buildings, bathrooms may need fire-rated doors, smoke barriers, or sprinkler coverage depending on local regulations. Compliance reduces fire hazards, protects occupants, and ensures the bathroom meets legal safety standards.
