## Mold prevention ##

Mold prevention in bathrooms focuses on controlling moisture, ventilation, and cleanliness to inhibit fungal growth. Key strategies include maintaining proper ventilation through exhaust fans or windows to reduce humidity, promptly fixing leaks in plumbing or waterproofing, and using water-resistant materials such as tiles, grout, and moisture-resistant drywall. Keeping surfaces dry, cleaning regularly with mold-inhibiting cleaners, and sealing tile joints and corners with quality caulk or grout also help prevent mold. Proper design of wet and dry zones, efficient drainage, and maintaining consistent airflow further reduce the risk of mold formation, ensuring a healthier and longer-lasting bathroom environment.
