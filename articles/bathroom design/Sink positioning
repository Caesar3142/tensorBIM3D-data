## Sink positioning ##

Sink positioning in a bathroom should prioritize accessibility, comfort, and functionality. The sink is typically placed in the dry zone, away from direct water splashes from the shower or bathtub. Standard height for a bathroom sink is around 32–36 inches (81–91 cm) from the floor to the countertop, with enough clearance in front—usually at least 21–24 inches (53–61 cm)—for comfortable use. There should also be at least 15–20 inches (38–51 cm) of space on either side of the sink to allow movement and placement of toiletries. For double vanities, spacing between sinks should provide individual user comfort, and wall-mounted or pedestal sinks should consider plumbing access and storage underneath. Proper lighting, mirror placement, and countertop depth (typically 20–24 inches or 51–61 cm) further enhance usability.
