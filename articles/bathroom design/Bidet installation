## Bidet installation ##

Bidet installation requires planning for both plumbing and space to ensure functionality and comfort. A bidet is typically installed next to the toilet, with enough clearance—usually about 15 to 20 inches from the centerline of adjacent fixtures—to allow comfortable use. It requires both cold and hot water connections, similar to a sink, and proper drainage to the sanitary system. Floor-mounted bidets are bolted to the floor, while wall-mounted units are supported by a concealed frame within the wall. Placement should allow easy access for cleaning and maintenance, and careful attention to water supply lines, drain slope, and waterproofing ensures safe, hygienic operation.
