## Load from bathtub ##

Load from a bathtub refers to the combined weight that the floor or slab must support, including the bathtub itself, the water it contains, and the occupants. A standard bathtub filled with water can weigh several hundred kilograms, and with one or two users, the total load can easily exceed 500–600 kilograms. Proper structural design considers this concentrated load, distributing it safely through the floor framing or reinforced concrete slab. Floor joists, beams, or slab reinforcement may need to be sized or strengthened accordingly, and additional support under the bathtub may be required for heavy freestanding tubs to prevent deflection, cracking, or long-term damage to the floor structure.
