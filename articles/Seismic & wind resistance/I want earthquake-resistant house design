## I want earthquake-resistant house design ##

An earthquake-resistant house design should prioritize structural integrity, ductility, and balanced load distribution. The building form should be simple and symmetrical to avoid torsional forces during seismic movement, and the foundation must be properly reinforced and tied together to distribute loads evenly. Use reinforced concrete frames or properly braced steel frames with strong beam-column connections to ensure flexibility without sudden failure. Shear walls should be strategically placed to resist lateral forces, and openings such as doors and windows must not weaken critical structural zones. Lightweight roofing materials reduce seismic load, and all structural elements—from roof to foundation—should be securely connected to create a continuous load path. Proper detailing, quality construction, and adherence to local seismic building codes are essential to ensure the house can withstand earthquake forces while minimizing damage and risk to occupants.
