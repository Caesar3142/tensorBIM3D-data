## Concealed vs exposed piping ##

Concealed piping is installed within walls, floors, or ceilings, keeping pipes hidden from view and providing a cleaner, more aesthetically pleasing bathroom appearance. It protects plumbing from accidental damage and reduces noise from water flow, but access for maintenance or repairs may require opening walls or panels. Exposed piping, in contrast, runs along the surface of walls or ceilings, making installation and maintenance easier and faster. It is often used in industrial-style designs or when retrofitting existing spaces. The choice between concealed and exposed piping depends on design preferences, ease of maintenance, installation costs, and the structural layout of the bathroom.
