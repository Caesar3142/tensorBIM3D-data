A cost-efficient layout for a low-income housing project should start with simplicity, repetition, and efficiency as the main design drivers. The layout must minimize construction cost, reduce long-term maintenance expenses, and still provide safe, healthy, and dignified living conditions for residents. This means avoiding unnecessary complexity in building form, circulation, and structural systems, while focusing on layouts that are easy to build, easy to maintain, and flexible enough to accommodate different household needs over time.

One of the most effective layout strategies is to use compact, repetitive unit modules. Standardizing unit sizes, room dimensions, and structural grids significantly reduces design and construction costs because it allows repetition of formwork, simplified detailing, and faster construction. Rectangular unit plans are generally the most economical, as they minimize wall length relative to floor area and simplify roofing and structural systems. Irregular shapes, angled walls, or excessive articulation should be avoided, as they increase material usage and labor complexity without adding functional value.

Efficient circulation planning is critical in low-income housing. Shared circulation spaces such as corridors, staircases, and access galleries should be minimized in area while still meeting safety and accessibility requirements. Walk-up housing with two to four storeys is often the most cost-effective typology, as it eliminates the need for elevators, which are expensive to install and maintain. Open-air corridors or access balconies can further reduce costs by minimizing enclosed space, lowering lighting and ventilation requirements, and improving natural airflow in warm climates.

The site layout should prioritize high land-use efficiency while maintaining adequate light, ventilation, and privacy. Row housing, double-loaded corridor blocks, or simple slab blocks arranged parallel to each other are commonly used because they allow high density with straightforward infrastructure layouts. Buildings should be arranged to maximize the number of units per length of road and utility line, as shorter infrastructure networks directly reduce project costs. Clear separation between vehicular access, pedestrian paths, and communal spaces improves safety and usability without requiring expensive design features.

Unit layouts themselves should focus on essential spaces only, with minimal circulation inside the unit. Open-plan living, dining, and kitchen areas reduce the need for internal corridors and walls, saving both construction cost and usable floor area. Wet areas such as bathrooms and kitchens should be stacked vertically and placed back-to-back between units wherever possible to minimize plumbing runs and simplify maintenance. Locating these service zones consistently across the project allows for standardized detailing and easier future repairs.

Structural efficiency is closely tied to layout efficiency. Using load-bearing walls or simple reinforced concrete frames with short spans reduces material usage and simplifies construction. Aligning walls and columns consistently from floor to floor avoids transfer structures and complex foundations. Floor-to-floor heights should be kept to the minimum allowed by building codes to reduce overall building volume, façade area, and material quantities, while still ensuring adequate daylight and ventilation.

Cost efficiency must also consider long-term operational expenses, not just initial construction cost. Layouts that promote natural lighting and cross-ventilation reduce dependence on artificial lighting and mechanical cooling, lowering energy costs for residents. Durable, low-maintenance finishes in high-use areas such as corridors, staircases, and unit entrances reduce repair and replacement costs over time. Providing simple but well-defined communal spaces, such as shared courtyards or playgrounds, improves social interaction and quality of life without requiring expensive amenities.

In summary, a cost-efficient layout for low-income housing relies on compact unit planning, standardized modules, minimal circulation, simple building forms, and efficient site organization. By focusing on functional necessity rather than architectural excess, the project can deliver a higher number of quality housing units within limited budgets, while still supporting comfort, safety, and long-term sustainability for residents.
