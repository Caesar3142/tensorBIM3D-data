## Optimize material waste in design ##

To optimize material waste in design, start by using a consistent modular grid that aligns with standard material dimensions such as concrete blocks, plywood sheets, steel lengths, and tile sizes. Design room dimensions and wall heights to match these standard sizes to minimize off-cuts and trimming. Keep the building form simple and rectangular to reduce complex intersections that generate excess waste. Standardize window and door sizes instead of custom dimensions, and coordinate structural spacing with finishing materials so elements fit efficiently. Use prefabricated or modular components where possible, as factory production typically reduces material loss. Early collaboration between architect, engineer, and contractor helps prevent design changes that lead to demolition and rework. Careful quantity takeoffs and accurate planning during procurement also reduce over-ordering. By designing with material dimensions and construction sequencing in mind, waste can be significantly minimized while maintaining quality and performance.
