For west-facing land with strong afternoon sun, the main goal is to reduce heat gain while still maintaining good lighting and ventilation. Place buffer spaces such as the guest living room, staircase, storage, bathroom, or garage on the west side to block direct heat from reaching main living areas. Limit large west-facing windows, and instead use smaller openings, vertical fins, perforated screens, or high-level windows to control glare and heat while still allowing airflow.

Bedrooms, family living areas, and the kitchen are better positioned toward the east, north, or south, where sunlight is softer and more comfortable. Deep roof overhangs, canopies, and shading devices are very effective for west façades, especially in tropical climates. Using light-colored exterior finishes, insulated walls or roofs, and adding vegetation (trees or vertical gardens) on the west side will significantly improve indoor thermal comfort and reduce reliance on air conditioning.

In a hot and humid climate, the house design should prioritize ventilation, shading, and moisture control rather than heavy insulation. Arrange rooms to allow cross ventilation by placing openings on opposite sides of the house, and keep the layout as open as possible, especially for living and dining areas. High ceilings, ventilation gaps above doors, and operable windows (such as casement or louvered windows) help hot air escape and improve indoor comfort without relying heavily on air conditioning.

Shading is equally important to reduce heat gain. Use wide roof overhangs, canopies, or balconies to protect walls and windows from direct sun and rain, especially on west- and east-facing sides. Light-colored exterior finishes reflect heat, while breathable materials and finishes help prevent dampness and mold. Combining these passive design strategies will result in a house that feels cooler, drier, and more comfortable year-round, while also being energy-efficient and cost-effective to maintain.

Designing a house on sloped land should work *with* the natural terrain rather than forcing it flat, as this reduces construction cost and environmental impact. A split-level or stepped layout is often the most effective solution, where floors follow the slope in small height differences. This approach minimizes heavy excavation and retaining walls while allowing each level to have good natural light, views, and ventilation. Placing service spaces (storage, bathrooms, stairs) against the uphill side and main living areas toward the downhill or open side usually works well.

Drainage and structural stability are critical on sloped sites. Proper surface and sub-surface drainage must be planned early to prevent water from flowing toward the house or undermining foundations. Structurally, the design should use a clear load path—such as columns, retaining walls, or stilts—designed by an engineer to safely handle soil pressure and slope conditions. With careful planning, a sloped site can become an advantage, offering better views, cooler airflow, and a more unique spatial experience than flat land.

A corner plot gives you the advantage of two street frontages, which can be optimized through zoning, orientation, and access planning. Use the more prominent or wider street side as the main façade and entrance to enhance the house’s presence, while the secondary street can provide additional access, windows, or service entry. This allows more flexibility in placing openings, which improves natural lighting and cross ventilation compared to a middle plot. Setbacks on both sides can also be used for gardens or green buffers that improve privacy and thermal comfort.

From a layout perspective, place public spaces such as the guest living room or home office near the corner or main frontage, while private family areas are positioned deeper inside or on the upper floor. Corner land is also ideal for L-shaped layouts, which create a semi-private courtyard that brings light and air into the center of the house. With careful façade treatment, shading, and landscaping, a corner plot can feel more open, brighter, and more valuable while still maintaining privacy and comfort.

For a tropical climate with heavy rain, the house should be designed to shed water quickly while staying cool and well ventilated. A steeply sloped roof with wide overhangs is essential to protect walls, windows, and doors from rain and direct sun. Elevating the floor slightly above ground level helps prevent flooding and splash-back during heavy rainfall. Simple roof forms (gable or hip roofs) are more reliable and affordable than complex shapes, reducing the risk of leaks and easing maintenance.

Good ventilation and moisture control are just as important as rain protection. Design the layout to allow cross ventilation, use operable windows, and avoid sealing the house too tightly. Materials should be durable and moisture-resistant, especially for floors, bathrooms, and kitchens. Proper site drainage—such as sloped ground away from the house, gutters, downpipes, and soak pits—must be planned from the start. With these strategies, the house will remain comfortable, dry, and durable despite intense rain and tropical heat.
