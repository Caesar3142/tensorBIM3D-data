## I want large glass façade, is it structurally safe? ##

A large glass façade can be structurally safe if it is properly engineered, but it requires careful design and appropriate materials. The glass itself is typically not load-bearing in standard residential construction; instead, it is supported by reinforced concrete, steel, or aluminum framing systems that transfer loads to the main structure. For safety, tempered or laminated safety glass should be used to resist impact and prevent dangerous shattering. Wind loads, especially in high-rise or coastal areas, must be calculated to determine glass thickness and framing requirements. Thermal expansion, structural movement, and seismic forces must also be accommodated with flexible connections and proper detailing. Additionally, energy performance and heat gain should be addressed with double or triple glazing, low-E coatings, and shading systems. When designed according to building codes and reviewed by a structural engineer, a large glass façade can be both safe and durable.
