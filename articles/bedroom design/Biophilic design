## Biophilic design ##

Biophilic design in a bedroom integrates natural elements and patterns to strengthen the connection between occupants and nature, typically through the use of indoor plants, natural materials like wood and stone, abundant daylight, views to the outdoors, organic shapes, natural textures, and earthy color palettes, while also incorporating ventilation, natural airflow, and sensory elements such as water features or natural scents where appropriate, all intended to reduce stress, improve well-being, enhance sleep quality, and create a calming, restorative environment.
