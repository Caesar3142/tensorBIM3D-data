## Ceiling height standards ##

Bedroom ceiling height standards are typically regulated by building codes to ensure adequate comfort, ventilation, and safety, with common minimum requirements of about 7 feet (2.1 m) clear height in many jurisdictions, while some codes allow slightly lower heights (around 6 feet 8 inches or 2.03 m) under beams or sloped ceilings provided a specified percentage of the room meets the minimum height, and higher ceilings of 8–9 feet (2.4–2.7 m) are often preferred in modern residential design to enhance spatial comfort, daylight distribution, air circulation, and overall room proportion.
