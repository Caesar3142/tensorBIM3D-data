## Privacy screen design ##

Privacy screen design in a bedroom involves creating visual separation without completely blocking light or airflow, typically using elements such as sliding panels, frosted or textured glass, wooden or metal slats, curtains, or room dividers, positioned to shield sleeping or dressing areas from adjacent rooms, corridors, or windows, while maintaining circulation, natural light, and aesthetic cohesion, allowing occupants to enjoy personal space, comfort, and intimacy without compromising openness or ventilation.
