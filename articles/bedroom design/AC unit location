## AC unit location ##

AC unit location in a bedroom should prioritize thermal comfort, air distribution, and noise control by positioning the indoor unit high on a wall to allow cool air to circulate evenly, avoiding direct airflow onto the bed to prevent drafts and discomfort, maintaining clear space around the unit for unobstructed intake and discharge, placing it away from heat sources or direct sunlight to improve efficiency, and ensuring the outdoor condenser is installed in a well-ventilated area to optimize performance while minimizing noise transmission into the sleeping space.
