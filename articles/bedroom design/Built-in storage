## Built-in storage ##

Built-in storage in a bedroom refers to custom-designed cabinetry or integrated units that are fixed into walls, niches, or under structural elements to maximize space efficiency and maintain a clean, cohesive appearance, typically including wardrobes, shelving, drawers, window seats with storage, or headboard-integrated cabinets, and planned to align with wall dimensions, ceiling height, and circulation requirements while concealing clutter, optimizing vertical space, and preserving functional movement areas without adding bulky standalone furniture.
