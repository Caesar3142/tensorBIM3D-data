## Bedroom orientation ##

Bedroom orientation refers to the directional positioning of the room within a building relative to the sun path, prevailing winds, and surrounding context to optimize daylight, thermal comfort, ventilation, and privacy, with east-facing bedrooms benefiting from gentle morning light, south-facing rooms (in the northern hemisphere) receiving consistent daylight and passive warmth, west-facing rooms exposed to stronger afternoon heat that may require shading, and north-facing rooms offering softer, cooler light, while careful orientation can also enhance cross ventilation, reduce cooling loads, and create a more comfortable and energy-efficient sleeping environment.
