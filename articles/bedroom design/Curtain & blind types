## Curtain & blind types ##

Curtain and blind types in bedroom design vary based on light control, privacy, and aesthetic preferences, with common curtain options including sheer curtains for diffused daylight, blackout curtains for maximum light blocking and improved sleep quality, and layered combinations for flexible control, while blind types include roller blinds for a clean minimalist look, Roman blinds for a softer fabric appearance, Venetian blinds (horizontal slats) for adjustable light filtering, vertical blinds for larger openings, and cellular or honeycomb blinds for enhanced thermal insulation, with selection depending on window size, orientation, desired ambiance, and functional performance requirements.
