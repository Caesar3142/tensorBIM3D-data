## Color psychology ##

Bedroom color psychology studies how different colors influence mood, energy, and relaxation in a sleeping space, with cool tones like blues and greens promoting calmness and restful sleep, warm neutrals such as beige or soft browns creating a cozy and comforting atmosphere, and brighter accents like yellow or coral adding energy or cheer without overwhelming, while darker shades can evoke intimacy and sophistication but may make a room feel smaller, and careful use of color combinations, saturation, and finishes helps support emotional well-being, visual comfort, and the desired ambiance in the bedroom.
