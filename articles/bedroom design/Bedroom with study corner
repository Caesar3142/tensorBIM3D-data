## Bedroom with study corner ##

A bedroom with a study corner should be organized to clearly separate sleeping and working functions while maintaining smooth circulation, typically positioning the desk near a window to benefit from natural light without causing screen glare, keeping at least 30 inches (75 cm) of clearance behind the chair for comfortable movement, placing the bed against a solid wall away from direct distractions, and using shelving, rugs, or subtle furniture orientation to define the study zone without overcrowding the room, ensuring that both areas remain functional, visually balanced, and free from circulation conflicts.
