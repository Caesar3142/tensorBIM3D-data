## Window acoustic performance ##

Window acoustic performance refers to a window’s ability to reduce the transmission of external noise into a bedroom, enhancing sleep quality and comfort, and is influenced by factors such as glazing type, frame material, sealing, and overall construction. Double- or triple-glazed windows with laminated or thicker glass provide better sound insulation, while airtight frames and well-sealed sashes prevent sound leaks. Additional measures such as insulated frames, secondary glazing, and minimizing gaps around window openings can further improve acoustic performance, ensuring that traffic, construction, or environmental noise is effectively reduced inside the room.
