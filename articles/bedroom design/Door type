## Door type ##

Door type in a bedroom affects privacy, space efficiency, and aesthetic appeal, with common options including hinged doors, which provide full access but require swing clearance; sliding doors, which save floor space and work well for wardrobes or compact layouts; pocket doors, which slide into the wall to maximize usable area; and bifold or folding doors, which reduce swing space while allowing wider openings, with material choices such as solid wood, engineered wood, glass, or metal influencing sound insulation, durability, and visual style, all coordinated to suit circulation, room function, and design theme.
