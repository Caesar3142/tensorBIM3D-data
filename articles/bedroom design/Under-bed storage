## Under-bed storage ##

Under-bed storage utilizes the space beneath the bed frame to increase storage capacity without occupying additional floor area, typically achieved through built-in drawers, pull-out boxes, lift-up hydraulic storage beds, or low-profile containers, requiring adequate clearance height (commonly 6–12 inches / 15–30 cm or more depending on design) and sufficient circulation space around the bed for easy access, while helping maintain organization, reduce clutter, and optimize compact bedroom layouts without compromising primary movement pathways.
