## Minimalist design ##

Minimalist bedroom design focuses on simplicity, functionality, and visual calm by incorporating only essential furniture such as a low-profile bed, compact bedside tables, and streamlined storage, using neutral or soft color palettes, clean lines, concealed storage solutions, and uncluttered surfaces to reduce visual noise, while maintaining generous circulation space, balanced proportions, and natural light to create a restful, organized, and spacious atmosphere that prioritizes comfort without unnecessary ornamentation.
