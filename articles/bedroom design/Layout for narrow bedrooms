## Layout for narrow bedrooms ##

A layout for narrow bedrooms should prioritize efficient circulation and visual openness by placing the bed lengthwise against the longest wall to maximize walking space, ideally using a low-profile or platform bed to reduce visual bulk, maintaining at least 24–30 inches (60–75 cm) of clearance along one accessible side, positioning wardrobes or built-in storage along one continuous wall to avoid fragmentation, using sliding doors instead of hinged ones to save space, selecting compact or wall-mounted nightstands, and incorporating vertical storage, mirrors, and light color schemes to enhance the sense of width while keeping pathways clear and uncluttered for comfortable movement.
