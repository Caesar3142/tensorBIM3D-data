## Simple ceiling design ##

A simple ceiling design in a bedroom focuses on clean lines, minimal detailing, and functional lighting integration, typically using a smooth painted surface or basic gypsum board finish in neutral colors such as white or soft beige to enhance brightness and visual height, optionally incorporating subtle recessed lighting or a single central light fixture, and maintaining adequate clear ceiling height without excessive drops or ornamentation, creating a calm, uncluttered, and cost-effective aesthetic that complements a restful sleeping environment.
