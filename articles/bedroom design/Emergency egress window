## Emergency egress window ##

A bedroom emergency egress window is a code-required opening that provides a safe escape route in case of fire or emergency, typically mandated in sleeping rooms to ensure occupants can exit directly to the outside and allow emergency responders to enter if needed, with common standards (such as in many U.S. codes) requiring a minimum clear opening area of about 5.7 square feet (0.53 m²), a minimum clear opening height of 24 inches (610 mm), a minimum clear width of 20 inches (510 mm), and a maximum sill height of 44 inches (1118 mm) above the floor, ensuring the window is easily operable from inside without tools or special knowledge while maintaining adequate access and safety.
