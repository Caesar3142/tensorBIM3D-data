## False ceiling design ##

False ceiling design in a bedroom involves installing a secondary suspended ceiling below the structural slab to conceal wiring, ducts, and structural elements while enhancing aesthetics, lighting integration, and acoustic performance, typically using materials such as gypsum board, plasterboard, metal grids, or PVC panels, and requiring careful coordination of drop height to maintain adequate clear ceiling height (often at least 7 feet / 2.1 m), proper placement of recessed or cove lighting, access panels for maintenance, and insulation layers where needed to improve thermal and sound control without compromising ventilation or spatial comfort.
