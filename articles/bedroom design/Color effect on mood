## Color effect on mood ##

Color affects mood by influencing psychological and emotional responses, with cool tones such as blue and green generally promoting calmness, relaxation, and mental clarity, warm tones like red and orange increasing energy and stimulation, soft neutrals such as beige and gray creating balance and stability, and brighter hues like yellow encouraging optimism and alertness, while saturation and brightness levels also play a role, as muted shades tend to feel soothing and intense colors can feel overwhelming, making thoughtful color selection essential for shaping atmosphere and emotional comfort within a space.
