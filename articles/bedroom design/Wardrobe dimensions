## Wardrobe dimensions ##

Wardrobe dimensions are determined by storage functionality and circulation requirements, with a typical minimum internal depth of about 24 inches (60 cm) to accommodate standard clothes hangers, a common height of 7–8 feet (2.1–2.4 m) to maximize vertical storage, and widths varying based on user needs but often starting from 3–6 feet (90–180 cm) for standard units, while walk-in wardrobes require at least 30–36 inches (75–90 cm) of clear aisle space for comfortable movement, and internal configurations usually include hanging sections (around 40–60 inches / 100–150 cm high), shelving, and drawers to ensure efficient and ergonomic storage.
