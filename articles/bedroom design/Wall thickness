## Wall thickness ##

Wall thickness in bedroom design affects structural stability, acoustic insulation, thermal performance, and usable floor area, as thicker walls generally provide better sound reduction from adjacent spaces, improved thermal insulation against outdoor temperature changes, and greater structural strength, but they also slightly reduce internal room dimensions within fixed building footprints, requiring careful coordination with door and window detailing, insulation materials, and service routing to balance comfort, energy efficiency, and spatial efficiency.
