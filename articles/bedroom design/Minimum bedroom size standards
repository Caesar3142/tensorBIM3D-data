## Minimum bedroom size standards ##

Minimum bedroom size standards vary by country and local building codes, but generally specify the minimum floor area, ceiling height, and egress requirements to ensure safety, health, and comfort. For example, in the UK, a single bedroom must typically be at least 6.51 m² for one person and 10.22 m² for two people, while in many parts of the United States, the International Residential Code (IRC) requires a minimum of 70 square feet (about 6.5 m²) for a bedroom occupied by one person, with no dimension less than 7 feet (2.13 m) in any direction. Bedrooms must also meet minimum ceiling height requirements (commonly around 7 feet or 2.1 m), include natural light and ventilation through windows or mechanical systems, and provide a compliant emergency escape and rescue opening (egress window). These standards are intended to prevent overcrowding, ensure adequate air circulation and daylight, and provide safe evacuation in case of fire or other emergencies.
