## Warm vs cool light temperature ##

Warm vs cool light temperature refers to the color appearance of artificial lighting measured in Kelvin (K), where warm light typically ranges from about 2700–3000K and produces a soft, yellowish glow that promotes relaxation and comfort, making it ideal for bedrooms and evening use, while cool light ranges from about 4000–6500K and emits a whiter or bluish tone that enhances alertness and visibility, often preferred for task-oriented areas, with the choice affecting mood, perceived room size, material color rendering, and overall ambiance, and many modern lighting systems allowing adjustable color temperatures to suit different activities and times of day.
