## Space-saving design ##

Space-saving design in a bedroom focuses on maximizing functionality within limited floor area by using compact layouts, multi-functional furniture such as storage beds or fold-down desks, built-in wardrobes that utilize vertical height, sliding or pocket doors to reduce swing clearance, wall-mounted shelves to free up floor space, and maintaining clear circulation paths, while carefully planning proportions and storage solutions to minimize clutter and create a visually open, efficient, and comfortable environment.
