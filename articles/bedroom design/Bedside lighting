## Bedside lighting ##

Bedside lighting should provide focused, comfortable illumination for reading and nighttime tasks without causing glare or disturbing a partner, typically achieved with wall-mounted sconces, pendant lights, or table lamps positioned about 24–30 inches (60–75 cm) above the mattress and aligned near shoulder height when seated, using warm color temperatures (around 2700–3000K) to create a relaxing atmosphere, incorporating individual switches or dimmers for user control, and directing light downward or through shaded fixtures to ensure adequate brightness while maintaining visual comfort and balanced bedroom ambiance.
