## Sliding vs hinged wardrobe ##

Sliding wardrobes use doors that move horizontally along tracks, making them ideal for compact bedrooms because they do not require additional clearance for door swings and allow continuous use of circulation space in front, while hinged wardrobes open outward on pivots, providing full access to the entire wardrobe width at once and often offering better visibility and simpler hardware maintenance, but requiring sufficient front clearance (typically 18–24 inches / 45–60 cm) for door operation, so the choice depends on room size, circulation space, accessibility preference, and aesthetic considerations.
