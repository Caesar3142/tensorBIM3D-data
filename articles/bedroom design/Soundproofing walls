## Soundproofing walls ##

Soundproofing walls in a bedroom involves reducing the transmission of noise from adjacent rooms or external sources to create a quiet, comfortable sleeping environment, typically achieved by adding mass and density with materials such as drywall or masonry, incorporating resilient channels or staggered/stud walls to decouple surfaces, using acoustic insulation like mineral wool or fiberglass within wall cavities, sealing gaps and penetrations with acoustic sealant to prevent sound leaks, and applying surface treatments such as acoustic panels or heavy curtains, all of which work together to minimize airborne and impact noise while maintaining thermal performance and structural integrity.
