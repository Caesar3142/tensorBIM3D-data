## Texture layering ##

Texture layering in bedroom design involves combining different tactile and visual surfaces to create depth, warmth, and interest within the space, typically mixing materials such as soft fabrics (bedding, cushions, rugs), smooth or glossy finishes (wood, metal, glass), natural elements (wood, stone, wicker), and patterned or textured surfaces (wall coverings, throws) in complementary colors and scales, while maintaining balance so that the room feels cozy and dynamic without clutter, enhancing both comfort and aesthetic richness through subtle contrasts and harmonious layering.
