## Glare control ##

Glare control in bedroom lighting design focuses on minimizing excessive brightness or contrast that can cause visual discomfort or reduce visibility, typically achieved by using shaded fixtures, diffusers, recessed lights, indirect lighting such as cove systems, proper fixture positioning outside direct sightlines, selecting appropriate lumen output, and balancing light levels between ambient and task sources, ensuring that light is distributed evenly across surfaces without harsh reflections on glossy finishes or direct exposure to high-intensity bulbs, thereby enhancing visual comfort, relaxation, and overall spatial quality.
