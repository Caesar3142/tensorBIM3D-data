## Artificial lighting layers ##

Artificial lighting layers in a bedroom refer to the combination of different lighting types to achieve functional, comfortable, and visually balanced illumination, typically consisting of ambient lighting for overall general brightness (such as ceiling fixtures or recessed lights), task lighting for specific activities like reading or working (such as bedside lamps or desk lights), and accent lighting to highlight architectural features or create mood (such as LED strips, wall sconces, or cove lighting), with proper layering allowing adjustable light levels, reduced glare, enhanced depth perception, and improved comfort while supporting both daytime and nighttime use.
