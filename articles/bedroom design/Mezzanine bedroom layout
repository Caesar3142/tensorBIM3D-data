## Mezzanine bedroom layout ##

A mezzanine bedroom layout should prioritize safety, headroom, and efficient use of vertical space by positioning the bed in the area with adequate ceiling clearance (ideally at least 6.5–7 feet / 2.0–2.1 m at the highest accessible point), ensuring safe and comfortable stair or ladder access with proper railing and guard protection, maintaining clear circulation of at least 24 inches (60 cm) around accessible sides of the bed, placing low-profile furniture to accommodate sloped or limited headroom, incorporating built-in storage along knee walls or under the mezzanine platform, and considering ventilation, lighting, and privacy since mezzanine levels are typically open to the space below.
