## Sleep-oriented design ##

Sleep-oriented design in a bedroom focuses on creating an environment that promotes restful, uninterrupted sleep by optimizing factors such as low noise levels through sound insulation, controlled lighting with blackout curtains and warm, dimmable fixtures, comfortable thermal conditions through proper insulation and ventilation, ergonomic bed height and mattress selection, calming color schemes, minimal visual clutter, reduced electronic distractions, and adequate air quality and humidity control, all carefully integrated to support circadian rhythms, relaxation, and overall well-being.
