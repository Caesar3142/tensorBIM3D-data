## Dimmable lighting systems ##

Dimmable lighting systems allow users to adjust light intensity according to activity, mood, and time of day, improving visual comfort, energy efficiency, and spatial flexibility by enabling bright illumination for tasks and softer levels for relaxation, typically using compatible dimmer switches, smart controls, or integrated LED drivers that regulate voltage or current, while requiring proper coordination between fixtures, bulbs, and control systems to prevent flickering, buzzing, or reduced lifespan, and supporting layered bedroom lighting by independently controlling ambient, task, and accent lighting zones for balanced and adaptable illumination.
