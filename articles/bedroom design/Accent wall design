## Accent wall design ##

Accent wall design in a bedroom involves highlighting a single wall to create visual interest, depth, or a focal point without overwhelming the space, typically achieved using contrasting paint colors, textured finishes, wallpaper, wood paneling, stone, or decorative elements such as artwork or lighting features, while keeping the remaining walls neutral to maintain balance, and positioning the accent wall behind key elements like the bed or seating area to enhance the room’s aesthetics, complement furniture, and reinforce the intended mood or style.
