## Window positioning for airflow ##

Window positioning for airflow in a bedroom should promote effective cross ventilation and occupant comfort by placing operable windows on opposite or adjacent walls to allow fresh air to enter from one side and exit from another, aligning openings with prevailing wind directions, positioning inlet windows at a lower level and outlet windows slightly higher when feasible to support natural buoyancy-driven airflow, keeping internal layouts and furniture clear of airflow paths, and selecting window types such as casement or louvered units that can direct breezes inward while maintaining privacy, thermal comfort, and consistent air exchange around the sleeping area.
