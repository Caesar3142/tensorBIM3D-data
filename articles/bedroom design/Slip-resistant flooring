## Slip-resistant flooring ##

Slip-resistant flooring in a bedroom enhances safety by reducing the risk of slips and falls, particularly for children and elderly occupants, typically achieved by selecting materials with adequate surface texture and friction such as matte-finish tiles, engineered wood with anti-slip coatings, low-pile carpets, cork, or vinyl flooring with textured surfaces, while avoiding highly polished or glossy finishes that can become slippery, and ensuring proper installation, flat transitions, and the use of non-slip rug pads where applicable to maintain both comfort and secure footing.
