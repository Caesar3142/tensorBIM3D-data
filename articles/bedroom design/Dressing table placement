## Dressing table placement ##

Dressing table placement in a bedroom should prioritize natural lighting, comfortable circulation, and functional zoning by positioning it near a window to benefit from soft, indirect daylight without causing glare on the mirror, maintaining at least 30 inches (75 cm) of clearance for chair movement, avoiding obstruction of door swings or primary walkways, and integrating it within the wardrobe or dressing area when possible to create an efficient transition between storage and grooming activities while preserving visual balance and spatial harmony.
