## Corner window bedroom layout ##

A corner window bedroom layout should be arranged to preserve natural light, ventilation, and views by keeping large furniture such as the bed against solid interior walls rather than blocking the glazing, maintaining at least 24–36 inches (60–90 cm) of clear circulation around accessible sides, positioning lower-profile pieces beneath window lines if necessary to avoid obstructing light, and using the bright corner area for a reading chair, small desk, or lounge spot to take advantage of daylight, while ensuring window operation remains unobstructed and the overall layout balances openness with functional zoning.
