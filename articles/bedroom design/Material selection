## Material selection ##

Material selection in bedroom design involves choosing surfaces, finishes, and furnishings that balance aesthetics, comfort, durability, and functionality, typically including natural materials like wood, stone, and textiles for warmth and texture, durable composites or metals for structural elements, soft fabrics for bedding and upholstery to enhance comfort, and finishes that are easy to maintain, safe, and compatible with lighting and color schemes, while also considering acoustic, thermal, and environmental performance to create a healthy, visually pleasing, and long-lasting interior environment.
