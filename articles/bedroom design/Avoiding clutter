## Avoiding clutter ##

Avoiding clutter in a bedroom involves maintaining clear circulation paths, limiting furniture to essential and functional pieces, incorporating adequate built-in or concealed storage such as wardrobes, under-bed drawers, and organizers, regularly decluttering unnecessary items, keeping surfaces like bedside tables and dressers minimally accessorized, using coordinated storage containers to maintain visual order, and applying a simple color palette to reduce visual noise, all of which contribute to a calm, organized, and restful sleeping environment.
