## Natural lighting orientation ##

Natural lighting orientation in bedroom design considers the direction of sunlight throughout the day to enhance comfort, energy efficiency, and mood, with east-facing rooms receiving soft morning light ideal for early risers, south-facing rooms (in the northern hemisphere) providing consistent daylight and warmth, west-facing rooms experiencing stronger afternoon heat that may require shading, and north-facing rooms offering more even but cooler light, so furniture placement should avoid blocking windows, beds should be positioned to minimize glare while still benefiting from daylight, and appropriate window treatments should be used to control brightness, heat gain, and privacy according to the room’s orientation.
