## Studio bedroom layout ##

A studio bedroom layout should efficiently combine sleeping, living, and sometimes working functions within a single open space by clearly zoning areas without full partitions, typically placing the bed against a wall or in a corner to preserve central circulation, maintaining at least 24–30 inches (60–75 cm) of clearance for movement, using furniture such as shelving units, curtains, or low partitions to subtly separate the sleeping area from the living or kitchen zone, selecting multi-functional pieces like storage beds or foldable desks to maximize space efficiency, and ensuring that pathways remain unobstructed while maintaining visual balance, privacy, and comfort within the compact layout.
