## Layout for square bedrooms ##

A layout for square bedrooms allows balanced and flexible furniture placement, typically centering the bed on one main wall to create symmetry and equal circulation on both sides, maintaining at least 24–36 inches (60–90 cm) of clearance for comfortable movement, positioning nightstands evenly for visual harmony, placing wardrobes or dressers along adjacent walls to avoid blocking pathways, and optionally creating a small functional zone such as a desk or reading chair in one corner, as the equal proportions of a square room make it easier to achieve visual balance, efficient circulation, and organized furniture zoning without the spatial constraints found in narrow layouts.
