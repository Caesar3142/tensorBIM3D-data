## Multifunctional furniture ##

Multifunctional furniture in a bedroom refers to pieces designed to serve more than one purpose to maximize space efficiency and flexibility, such as storage beds with built-in drawers, fold-down desks integrated into wardrobes, sofa beds, ottomans with hidden compartments, or wall-mounted foldable tables, allowing compact rooms to accommodate sleeping, working, and storage needs without overcrowding, while maintaining clear circulation paths, reducing clutter, and supporting adaptable layouts suited for modern living environments.
