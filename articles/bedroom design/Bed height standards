## Bed height standards ##

Bed height standards typically aim to provide ergonomic comfort and ease of use, with common mattress top heights ranging from about 18 to 25 inches (45–63 cm) from the floor, allowing most adults to sit on the edge with feet flat on the ground and knees at approximately a 90-degree angle, while lower heights may suit minimalist designs and younger users, and slightly higher beds (around 22–25 inches / 55–63 cm) are often preferred in elderly-friendly bedrooms to make sitting and standing easier without excessive strain.
