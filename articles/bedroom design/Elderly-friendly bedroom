## Elderly-friendly bedroom ##

An elderly-friendly bedroom is designed to enhance safety, accessibility, and comfort by providing ample circulation space (typically at least 36 inches / 90 cm for clear pathways), minimizing level changes or thresholds to prevent tripping, using non-slip flooring, ensuring adequate layered and glare-free lighting, positioning the bed at an ergonomic height for easy sitting and standing, incorporating sturdy grab bars or support rails if needed, selecting easy-to-operate door handles and window systems, and arranging furniture to avoid sharp corners or obstructions, all while maintaining a calm and supportive environment that promotes independence and ease of movement.
