## Walk-in closet integration ##

Walk-in closet integration should create a smooth and logical transition between sleeping and dressing areas by positioning the closet adjacent to the bedroom or as a passage toward an ensuite bathroom, maintaining at least 30–36 inches (75–90 cm) of clear circulation within the closet aisles, using built-in storage along both sides when space allows, ensuring door swings or sliding systems do not interfere with bedroom furniture, and visually separating the closet zone through partial partitions or recessed entries so that storage remains accessible yet discreet, preserving privacy, organization, and balanced spatial flow within the overall bedroom layout.
