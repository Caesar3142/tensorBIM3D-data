## Circulation space around bed ##

Circulation space around a bed refers to the clear walking area needed for comfortable movement, safety, and functionality within a bedroom, with common design guidelines recommending at least 24 inches (60 cm) of clearance on one side for minimum access, 30–36 inches (75–90 cm) on both sides for better comfort in shared bedrooms, and at least 36 inches (90 cm) at the foot of the bed to allow easy passage, furniture access, and door clearance, ensuring that occupants can get in and out of bed comfortably, change linens easily, access closets or bathrooms without obstruction, and maintain a balanced and practical room layout.
