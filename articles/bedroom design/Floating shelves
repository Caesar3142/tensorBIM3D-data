## Floating shelves ##

Floating shelves are wall-mounted storage elements designed without visible brackets or supports, creating a clean, minimalist appearance while providing functional display or storage space in bedrooms, typically installed with concealed metal brackets or internal support systems anchored securely into studs or solid walls, and positioned at ergonomic heights to avoid head clearance conflicts, maintain circulation space, and balance visual composition, while their load capacity depends on shelf material, thickness, span length, and the strength of the wall anchoring system.
