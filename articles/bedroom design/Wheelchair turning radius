## Wheelchair turning radius ##

Wheelchair turning radius refers to the minimum clear floor space required for a wheelchair to make a full 180-degree turn comfortably and safely, typically requiring a circular space of at least 60 inches (1525 mm) in diameter according to common accessibility standards, or a T-shaped turning space with 36-inch (915 mm) wide arms within a 60-inch square, ensuring adequate maneuverability in bedrooms and other interior spaces without obstruction from furniture, walls, or door swings.
