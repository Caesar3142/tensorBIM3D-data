## Lighting impact on sleep ##

Lighting impacts sleep by influencing the body’s circadian rhythm, as exposure to bright or blue-enriched light in the evening can suppress melatonin production and delay sleep onset, while warm, low-intensity lighting (around 2700–3000K) helps signal the body to relax and prepare for rest, making it important in bedroom design to use dimmable fixtures, layered lighting, blackout window treatments to block external light at night, and maximize natural daylight exposure during the morning to support a healthy sleep–wake cycle and overall sleep quality.
