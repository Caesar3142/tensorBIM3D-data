## Scandinavian bedroom ##

A Scandinavian bedroom is characterized by simplicity, functionality, and a cozy, inviting atmosphere, typically featuring light, neutral color palettes with whites, soft grays, and pale woods, natural materials such as wood and textiles, clean and simple furniture lines, ample natural light, and minimal but thoughtful decorative accents, often incorporating layered bedding, rugs, and soft lighting to create warmth and comfort, while maintaining uncluttered layouts, balanced proportions, and a sense of openness that combines practicality with hygge-inspired coziness.
