## Structural opening limits for windows ##

Structural opening limits for windows are governed by the need to maintain adequate load transfer and wall stability, as enlarging openings reduces the effective load-bearing area of a wall and requires proper support through lintels, headers, reinforced concrete beams, or steel framing to redistribute vertical and lateral loads around the opening, with limits influenced by wall type (load-bearing masonry, reinforced concrete, or framed systems), span length, building height, and local structural codes, ensuring that window size and placement do not compromise structural integrity, cause excessive deflection or cracking, or weaken resistance to wind and seismic forces.
