## Bedroom with ensuite bathroom ##

A bedroom with an ensuite bathroom should be arranged to maintain privacy, smooth circulation, and functional zoning, typically positioning the bed away from direct sightlines into the bathroom, keeping at least 30–36 inches (75–90 cm) of clear walking space leading to the bathroom door, ensuring the door swing does not interfere with furniture placement, and using solid walls or partial partitions to enhance acoustic separation, while wardrobes or dressing areas are often placed near the bathroom entrance to create an efficient transition between sleeping, dressing, and bathing zones without disrupting comfort or visual balance in the room.
