## Window size & placement ##

Window size and placement in a bedroom should balance natural light, ventilation, privacy, and furniture layout, typically ensuring the glazed area meets building code requirements for daylight and emergency egress, positioning windows to allow cross-ventilation when possible, placing them high enough or offset from corners to maintain usable wall space for beds and wardrobes, avoiding direct alignment with the bed headboard for better thermal comfort and privacy, and sizing openings proportionally to the room so they provide sufficient illumination without causing excessive glare or heat gain, while maintaining at least the minimum clear opening dimensions required for safe escape in case of emergency.
