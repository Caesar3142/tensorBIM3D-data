## Column placement inside bedroom ##

Column placement inside a bedroom should minimize disruption to circulation, furniture layout, and visual balance by positioning structural columns along perimeter walls or integrating them within wardrobes, partitions, or built-in storage where possible, maintaining clear walking space of at least 24–36 inches (60–90 cm) around primary pathways, avoiding placement that interferes with bed alignment or door swings, and using architectural treatments such as cladding, shelving integration, or recessed niches to visually soften the column’s presence while preserving structural function and overall spatial harmony.
