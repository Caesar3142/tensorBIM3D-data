## Standard vs custom furniture ##

Standard bedroom furniture refers to pre-made, mass-produced pieces with fixed sizes and designs that are generally more affordable, easier to find, and quicker to install but may not fit every space perfectly, while custom furniture is tailor-made to match your specific room dimensions, style preferences, and storage needs, offering better utilization of awkward spaces and a more personalized look but typically costing more and taking longer to design and build.
