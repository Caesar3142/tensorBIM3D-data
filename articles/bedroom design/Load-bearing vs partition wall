## Load-bearing vs partition wall ##

Load-bearing walls are structural elements designed to support and transfer vertical loads from slabs, beams, or roofs down to the foundation, making them critical to the building’s stability and generally not removable without structural modification, while partition walls are non-structural elements used primarily to divide interior spaces, carrying only their self-weight and sometimes minor fixtures, allowing greater flexibility for alteration or removal during renovation, with differences affecting construction thickness, material selection, reinforcement requirements, and the ability to modify room layouts such as bedrooms.
