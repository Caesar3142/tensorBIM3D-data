## Seismic considerations ##

Seismic considerations in bedroom design focus on ensuring occupant safety and structural resilience during earthquakes by incorporating properly designed load-bearing systems such as reinforced concrete frames, shear walls, or braced structures to resist lateral forces, securely anchoring non-structural elements like wardrobes, shelves, false ceilings, and lighting fixtures to prevent tipping or falling, limiting large unreinforced openings in structural walls, maintaining adequate connections between beams, columns, and slabs, and complying with local seismic codes to control drift, prevent structural collapse, and minimize damage while preserving safe egress and functional integrity of the space.
