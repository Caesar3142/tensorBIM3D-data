## Fire safety requirements ##

Bedroom fire safety requirements focus on ensuring safe evacuation, early detection, and reduced fire spread, typically including the installation of smoke alarms inside or immediately outside sleeping areas, at least one compliant emergency egress window or door for direct escape, minimum door widths and unobstructed exit pathways, fire-resistant wall and ceiling assemblies where required by code, properly rated electrical wiring and outlets to prevent ignition risks, safe placement of heating or air-conditioning units away from flammable materials, and the use of flame-retardant furnishings or finishes where applicable, all coordinated to meet local building and fire codes to protect occupants during emergencies.
