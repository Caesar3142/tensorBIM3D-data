## TV unit placement ##

TV unit placement in a bedroom should ensure comfortable viewing angles, proper distance, and unobstructed circulation by positioning the screen directly opposite or slightly angled from the bed at eye level when seated or reclined, maintaining an appropriate viewing distance typically 1.5–2.5 times the screen’s diagonal size, avoiding glare from windows by placing it perpendicular to natural light sources, securing wall-mounted units properly for safety, and ensuring that cabinetry or consoles do not block primary walkways or interfere with door swings while maintaining balanced furniture zoning.
