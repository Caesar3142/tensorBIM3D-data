## Minimal electronic exposure ##

Minimal electronic exposure in a bedroom involves reducing the presence and use of electronic devices to promote better sleep quality and mental relaxation, typically by limiting televisions, laptops, and smartphones in the sleeping area, avoiding bright screens and blue light before bedtime, keeping charging stations away from the bed, turning off or covering indicator lights, minimizing electromagnetic and notification disturbances, and prioritizing soft lighting, natural materials, and calm surroundings to support a restful, distraction-free sleep environment.
