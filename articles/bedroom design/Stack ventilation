## Stack ventilation ##

Stack ventilation in a bedroom is a natural airflow strategy that relies on the buoyancy effect, where warm air rises and exits through higher-level openings such as clerestory windows, vents, or upper louvers, while cooler fresh air enters through lower windows or openings, creating vertical air movement without mechanical assistance, and requires sufficient height difference between inlet and outlet openings, unobstructed internal airflow paths, and operable window placement to enhance pressure differentials, thereby improving thermal comfort, reducing heat buildup, and maintaining indoor air quality through continuous passive ventilation.
