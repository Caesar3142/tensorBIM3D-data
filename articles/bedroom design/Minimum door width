## Minimum door width ##

Minimum door width standards are typically established by building codes to ensure safe access, movement of furniture, and emergency egress, with common residential requirements specifying a minimum clear opening of about 32 inches (810 mm) for accessibility compliance (such as wheelchair access), while standard interior bedroom doors are often 28–32 inches (710–810 mm) wide, and in accessible or elderly-friendly designs, wider doors are recommended to improve maneuverability, safety, and ease of use without obstructing circulation.
