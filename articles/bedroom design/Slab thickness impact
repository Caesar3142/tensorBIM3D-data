## Slab thickness impact ##

Slab thickness impacts bedroom design by influencing structural capacity, floor-to-ceiling height, acoustic performance, and thermal mass, as thicker slabs generally provide greater load-bearing strength, improved sound insulation between floors, and enhanced temperature stability due to increased mass, but they also reduce clear vertical space within a fixed building height and may increase material cost and construction weight, requiring careful coordination with beam depth, ceiling finishes, and service routing to maintain adequate headroom, comfort, and overall spatial efficiency.
