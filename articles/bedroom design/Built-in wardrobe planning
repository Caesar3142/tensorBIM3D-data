## Built-in wardrobe planning ##

Built-in wardrobe planning should focus on maximizing storage efficiency while maintaining comfortable bedroom circulation, typically allocating a minimum depth of about 24 inches (60 cm) for hanging clothes, ensuring at least 30–36 inches (75–90 cm) of clear space in front for easy access, positioning the wardrobe along a full wall to create a clean and continuous visual line, using sliding doors in tighter rooms to avoid door swing conflicts, organizing the interior with a combination of hanging rails, shelves, drawers, and overhead storage based on user needs, and aligning the wardrobe placement so it does not block natural light, doorways, or primary movement paths within the room.
