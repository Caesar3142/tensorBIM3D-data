## Natural materials ##

Natural materials in a bedroom enhance comfort, warmth, and well-being by incorporating elements such as solid wood for flooring and furniture, cotton or linen for bedding and curtains, wool or jute for rugs, rattan or bamboo for accents, and stone or clay-based finishes for subtle texture, all of which provide breathable, low-toxicity, and thermally balanced surfaces that improve indoor air quality and create a calming, organic atmosphere while supporting durability, sustainability, and visual harmony within the space.
