## Industrial bedroom ##

An industrial bedroom features a raw, edgy aesthetic inspired by converted lofts and warehouses, typically incorporating exposed structural elements like brick walls, concrete or metal surfaces, visible beams or ductwork, and a neutral, muted color palette with shades of gray, black, and brown, while furniture often includes metal frames, reclaimed wood, and simple geometric forms; the design emphasizes functional layouts, minimal ornamentation, and open space, often complemented by statement lighting, rugged textures, and vintage or repurposed accessories to create a bold yet practical and lived-in atmosphere.
