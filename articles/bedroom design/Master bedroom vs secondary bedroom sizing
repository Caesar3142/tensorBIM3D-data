## Master bedroom vs secondary bedroom sizing ##

A master bedroom (often called the primary bedroom) is typically the largest bedroom in a house, designed to accommodate a king-size bed, larger circulation space, additional furniture such as dressers or seating, and often direct access to an ensuite bathroom and walk-in closet, with common sizes ranging from about 12 × 14 feet (168 sq ft / 15.6 m²) to 16 × 20 feet (320 sq ft / 29.7 m²) or more, whereas a secondary bedroom is smaller and intended for children, guests, or flexible uses like a home office, usually fitting a twin or queen-size bed with minimal extra furniture and commonly ranging from about 9 × 10 feet (90 sq ft / 8.4 m²) to 11 × 12 feet (132 sq ft / 12.3 m²), with the key differences being overall floor area, furniture capacity, level of privacy, and presence of attached amenities.
Bed placement rules generally focus on comfort, functionality, and circulation, with the bed ideally positioned against a solid wall (not under a window if possible) to provide a sense of stability and support, allowing at least 24–30 inches (60–75 cm) of walking space on accessible sides for easy movement, keeping it clear of door swing paths and direct alignment with the doorway for privacy, centering it on the main wall when feasible to create visual balance, ensuring access to natural light without blocking windows, and placing bedside tables and lighting within comfortable reach to support everyday use while maintaining clear, safe pathways throughout the room.
