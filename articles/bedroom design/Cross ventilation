## Cross ventilation ##

Cross ventilation in bedroom design is achieved by placing operable openings such as windows or vents on opposite or adjacent walls to allow fresh air to flow in from one side and exit from another, creating continuous natural airflow that improves indoor air quality, reduces humidity, and enhances thermal comfort, particularly in warm climates, while requiring unobstructed internal layouts, appropriately sized inlet and outlet openings, alignment with prevailing wind directions, and careful furniture placement to avoid blocking airflow paths so that the sleeping area benefits from steady, gentle air movement without drafts or discomfort.
