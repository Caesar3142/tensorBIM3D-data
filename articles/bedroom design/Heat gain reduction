## Heat gain reduction ##

Bedroom heat gain reduction focuses on minimizing unwanted solar and conductive heat entering the space to improve thermal comfort and reduce cooling loads, typically achieved through proper room orientation, external shading devices such as overhangs or louvers, insulated walls and roofs, double-glazed or low-emissivity windows, reflective or light-colored exterior finishes, airtight construction to prevent hot air infiltration, strategic window placement to limit direct afternoon sun exposure, and integration of natural ventilation or ceiling fans to dissipate accumulated heat effectively.
