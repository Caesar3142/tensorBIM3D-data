## Humidity control ##

Bedroom humidity control aims to maintain indoor relative humidity typically between 40–60% to ensure thermal comfort, prevent mold growth, reduce dust mites, and protect furniture and finishes, achieved through proper ventilation strategies such as cross or stack ventilation, use of exhaust fans or dehumidifiers in humid climates, humidifiers in dry conditions, effective thermal insulation to minimize condensation, well-sealed building envelopes to prevent moisture intrusion, and integration with air conditioning or HVAC systems that regulate moisture levels alongside temperature for a healthier and more stable sleeping environment.
