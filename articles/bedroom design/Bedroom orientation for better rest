## Bedroom orientation for better rest ##

Bedroom orientation for better rest focuses on positioning the room to optimize natural light, thermal comfort, noise control, and ventilation, typically favoring east-facing orientations to receive gentle morning sunlight that supports healthy circadian rhythms while avoiding excessive afternoon heat from west exposure, minimizing proximity to noisy streets or active zones of the house, aligning windows with prevailing breezes for natural airflow, and incorporating shading or insulation where needed to maintain stable nighttime temperatures, all contributing to a calm, comfortable, and sleep-supportive environment.
