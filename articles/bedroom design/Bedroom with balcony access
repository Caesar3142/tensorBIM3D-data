## Bedroom with balcony access ##

A bedroom with balcony access should be planned to maintain clear and unobstructed circulation to the balcony door, keeping at least 30–36 inches (75–90 cm) of walking space in front of the opening, positioning the bed against a solid wall rather than directly blocking the doorway, and ensuring door swing or sliding panels operate freely without interfering with furniture, while also considering natural light and ventilation by avoiding heavy furniture near the balcony glazing, using low-profile pieces to preserve views, and arranging seating or a small lounge chair near the balcony to create a smooth indoor–outdoor connection without disrupting privacy or room functionality.
