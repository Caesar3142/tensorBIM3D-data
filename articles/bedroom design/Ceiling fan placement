## Ceiling fan placement ##

Ceiling fan placement in a bedroom should ensure balanced air distribution and occupant comfort by centering the fan over the bed or in the middle of the room when possible, maintaining a minimum clearance of about 7 feet (2.1 m) from floor to blades and at least 8–10 inches (20–25 cm) below the ceiling for optimal airflow, keeping blades at least 18 inches (45 cm) away from walls or tall furniture to prevent turbulence, aligning the fan with the room’s primary circulation area, and selecting appropriate blade span based on room size to provide gentle, even airflow without excessive noise or drafts directly onto occupants.
