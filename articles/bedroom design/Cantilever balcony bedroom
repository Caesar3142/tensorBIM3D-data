## Cantilever balcony bedroom ##

A cantilever balcony in a bedroom is a projecting outdoor platform supported structurally at one end without visible columns beneath, extending from the main building frame, and requires careful structural design to manage bending moments, deflection, and load transfer back into the slab or beam system, while also addressing waterproofing, thermal bridging, and acoustic separation to prevent heat loss, moisture intrusion, or vibration transmission into the bedroom, with interior layout planning ensuring clear circulation to the balcony door, adequate insulation at the slab edge, and proper drainage detailing to maintain comfort, durability, and safety.
