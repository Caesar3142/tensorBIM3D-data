## Thermal insulation ##

Thermal insulation in a bedroom is designed to reduce heat transfer through walls, ceilings, floors, and windows to maintain stable indoor temperatures, improve energy efficiency, and enhance sleeping comfort, typically achieved by installing insulation materials such as fiberglass, mineral wool, foam boards, or spray foam within wall cavities and roof assemblies, sealing air gaps to prevent drafts, using insulated glazing or double-glazed windows to limit heat gain and loss, and incorporating proper vapor barriers where required to control moisture, thereby minimizing temperature fluctuations, reducing reliance on heating or cooling systems, and creating a quieter, more thermally consistent environment.
