## Cove lighting ##

Cove lighting is an indirect lighting technique where light fixtures, typically LED strips, are concealed within recessed ceiling details, ledges, or wall moldings to reflect light onto adjacent surfaces such as ceilings or upper walls, creating a soft, diffuse glow that enhances depth and ambiance without visible glare, commonly used in bedrooms to provide warm ambient illumination, highlight architectural features, and support layered lighting design, while requiring careful planning of recess dimensions, reflective surface finishes, and appropriate color temperature to achieve even light distribution and avoid shadow lines or hotspots.
