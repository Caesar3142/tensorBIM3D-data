## bedroom Distance from living room ##

The distance of a bedroom from the living room is an important consideration for privacy, noise control, and comfort, with best practices placing bedrooms—especially master and secondary sleeping areas—away from high-traffic, noisy zones such as living rooms, kitchens, or entertainment areas, ideally separated by hallways, corridors, or buffer spaces, and using walls, doors, and acoustic treatments to reduce sound transmission, so that occupants can enjoy restful sleep and uninterrupted privacy while common areas remain accessible and functional.
