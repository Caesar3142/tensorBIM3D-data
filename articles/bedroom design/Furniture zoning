## Furniture zoning ##

Furniture zoning is the strategic arrangement of furniture within a room to create distinct functional areas—such as sleeping, working, dressing, or relaxing—while maintaining clear circulation paths and visual balance, typically achieved by grouping related pieces together (for example, bed and nightstands in a sleeping zone, desk and chair in a work zone, dresser and mirror in a dressing zone), using rugs, lighting, or subtle layout changes to define boundaries without walls, and ensuring adequate spacing between zones so movement remains comfortable and the room feels organized rather than cluttered.
