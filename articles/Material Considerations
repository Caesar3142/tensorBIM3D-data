## Material Considerations ##

The shower’s material selections will be the most noticeable thing about it. In addition to choosing an aesthetically pleasing material, it is also essential to consider the material’s safety and maintenance. To help ensure safety, try to choose nonslip flooring materials that are textured or matte for better traction. Some materials may require grout. Consider whether you are up to the task of cleaning and maintaining the grout lines. If you are not up to the task, choose materials that need less cleaning or maintenance. To make your shower more visually interesting, consider incorporating a vertical or horizontal accent band to add character. Similarly, if your shower has a niche, consider having the niche backing material stand out to make it a focal point. Lastly, ensure the shower’s chosen materials align with your goals for the overall bathroom design style, such as modern, contemporary, retro, etc.
