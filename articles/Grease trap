## Grease trap ##

A grease trap is a plumbing device installed in bathrooms with sinks or kitchens to intercept and collect fats, oils, and grease (FOG) from wastewater before it enters the sewer system. It works by slowing down the flow of water, allowing grease to float to the surface while solids settle at the bottom, with relatively cleaner water exiting to the drainage system. Grease traps prevent clogs, reduce odor problems, and protect municipal sewer lines from buildup. Proper sizing, regular cleaning, and correct placement near the source of greasy wastewater are essential for effective operation and to comply with local plumbing regulations.
