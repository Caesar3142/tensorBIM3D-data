## I want master bedroom facing garden ##

To design a master bedroom facing the garden, position it at the rear or side of the house where it can directly overlook and access the outdoor space, creating a calm and private retreat. Use large sliding glass doors or wide windows to frame garden views and maximize natural light, while incorporating sheer curtains or layered blinds for adjustable privacy. If space allows, add a small private terrace or deck that extends into the garden, enhancing the indoor–outdoor connection. The bed can be oriented toward the view so the garden becomes the focal point upon entering the room. An ensuite bathroom can be placed behind or beside the sleeping area for functional zoning, and built-in wardrobes can act as sound buffers from noisier parts of the house. Landscaping with soft greenery, subtle lighting, and possibly a water feature will further enhance the relaxing atmosphere and make the master bedroom feel like a private sanctuary.
