A 3 m × 3 m kitchen (9 m²) is compact but can be very functional if the layout is efficient and circulation is well planned. The key is to maintain the work triangle between the sink, stove, and refrigerator while ensuring at least 90 cm of clear walking space.

One efficient layout for this size is an L-shaped kitchen along two adjacent walls. For example, place the sink centered on one wall under a window for natural light and ventilation. On the adjoining wall, position the cooktop with counter space on both sides for safety and preparation. The refrigerator can be placed at the end of one run so it does not interrupt the main preparation zone. This configuration keeps the work triangle compact and efficient.

In a 3 m × 3 m space, standard countertop depth of about 60 cm works well. If you use two walls for cabinets, that leaves approximately 1.8 meters of clear width in the middle, which is enough for comfortable movement. Avoid placing cabinets on all four walls because that would reduce circulation space too much.

If storage is a priority, you can use an L-shaped layout plus a short peninsula extending about 1.2 meters from one wall. The peninsula can serve as additional prep space or a small breakfast counter for two people. Ensure there is still at least 90 cm clearance between the peninsula and the opposite wall.

A U-shaped layout is also possible in 3 m × 3 m, but it must be carefully designed. With three sides of 60 cm deep cabinets, the remaining center space will be about 1.8 m × 1.8 m, which is acceptable. However, avoid overcrowding with bulky appliances. In this case, position the sink on one side, cooktop on another, and refrigerator on the third side to form a compact triangle.

To maximize storage, use full-height cabinets up to the ceiling on one wall. Install upper cabinets at around 60–75 cm above the countertop. Light-colored finishes help the small space feel larger and brighter. Under-cabinet lighting improves both function and visual spaciousness.

Ventilation is important in small kitchens. Install a good range hood above the cooktop and provide a window or ventilation opening if possible. Good airflow prevents heat and cooking odors from accumulating.

For flooring, use the same material as adjacent spaces if the kitchen is open-plan. This visually expands the space. Keep cabinet handles minimal and use integrated appliances where possible to maintain a clean look.

In summary, for a 3 m × 3 m kitchen, an L-shaped layout is usually the most balanced option, while a compact U-shape is also feasible. Maintain a 90 cm minimum circulation path, optimize vertical storage, and keep the work triangle efficient for maximum functionality within a small footprint.
