## I want kitchen hidden from living room view ##

To keep the kitchen hidden from the living room view, position it slightly offset from the main living axis rather than directly aligned with the entrance or seating area. You can use an L-shaped or U-shaped layout tucked behind a partial wall, vertical screen, or sliding partition to block direct sightlines while maintaining easy access. A kitchen island or tall cabinetry can act as a visual buffer, and incorporating pocket doors or concealed panels allows the kitchen to be fully closed off when needed. Placing the kitchen toward the rear of the house also helps contain noise and cooking odors, especially if paired with good ventilation. This approach preserves an open and connected layout while ensuring the living room maintains a clean, uncluttered appearance.
