## Optimize circulation flow for small house ##

To optimize circulation flow in a small house, minimize dedicated hallway space and instead allow rooms to connect directly in a logical sequence, such as living to dining to kitchen without unnecessary partitions. Place the entrance so it leads naturally into the main living area, avoiding long corridors that waste floor area. Group related functions together—such as stacking bathrooms and aligning kitchen and laundry—to shorten travel distances and simplify plumbing. Position bedrooms in a compact cluster with a small shared landing rather than a long hallway. Use sliding or pocket doors to reduce door swing conflicts, and keep primary circulation paths at least 80–90 cm wide for comfort. Visual continuity through consistent flooring and aligned openings can make movement feel smoother and the space feel larger, ensuring every square meter contributes to both function and comfort.
