## Separate public and private zones in a 2-story house ##

In a two-story house, public and private zones can be clearly separated by placing social and shared spaces on the ground floor and reserving the upper floor for bedrooms and family-only areas. The ground floor should include the living room near the entrance, followed by the dining area and kitchen in an open or semi-open arrangement, along with a guest bathroom and possibly a guest bedroom or home office. The staircase should be positioned slightly away from the main entrance to avoid direct views into the private level. The second floor should contain the master bedroom, secondary bedrooms, and shared bathrooms, with a small landing or family lounge acting as a buffer before entering the bedrooms. Stacking bathrooms vertically improves plumbing efficiency, and using solid doors and proper insulation enhances privacy and acoustic separation between zones.
