## I want an open-plan living-dining-kitchen concept ##

An open-plan living–dining–kitchen concept removes unnecessary walls to create one continuous, flowing space that feels larger, brighter, and more social. The layout typically positions the living area at the front (near large windows or sliding doors), the dining area in the center as a transition zone, and the kitchen at the rear or along one side wall for efficient plumbing and ventilation. A kitchen island or peninsula can act as a subtle divider while providing additional storage, prep space, and casual seating. To maintain visual harmony, use consistent flooring throughout the space and a cohesive color palette, while defining zones through ceiling treatments, lighting layers, or area rugs rather than walls. Maximize natural light with wide openings and consider cross-ventilation for comfort. Built-in cabinetry, concealed storage, and integrated appliances help keep the space uncluttered, ensuring the open plan remains functional, airy, and inviting for both daily living and entertaining.
