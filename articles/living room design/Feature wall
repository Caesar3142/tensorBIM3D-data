## Feature wall ##

A feature wall in a living room serves as a striking focal point that adds personality and depth to the space. It can be created with bold paint colors, textured materials such as stone or wood slats, patterned wallpaper, or artistic panels. Often placed behind a sofa, fireplace, or entertainment unit, the feature wall anchors the layout and highlights key elements of the room’s design. When thoughtfully balanced with the surrounding finishes, it enhances visual interest without overwhelming the overall aesthetic.
