## Water feature integration ##

Water feature integration in a living room introduces a calming sensory element through the sound and movement of water. Options such as wall-mounted fountains, small indoor ponds, or vertical waterfall features can serve as striking focal points while enhancing tranquility. Proper waterproofing, drainage, and humidity control are essential to protect surrounding finishes and maintain indoor comfort. When thoughtfully designed, a water feature adds a unique blend of luxury, relaxation, and connection to nature within the living space.
