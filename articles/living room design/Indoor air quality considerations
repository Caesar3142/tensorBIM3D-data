## Indoor air quality considerations ##

Indoor air quality considerations in a living room focus on maintaining healthy, fresh, and well-circulated air. Proper natural ventilation through operable windows or cross ventilation strategies helps remove indoor pollutants and excess humidity. Using low-VOC paints, finishes, and furnishings reduces harmful emissions, while indoor plants and air purifiers can further enhance air cleanliness. Regular maintenance of HVAC systems and filters is also essential to ensure efficient airflow and minimize dust accumulation, creating a more comfortable and healthier living environment.
