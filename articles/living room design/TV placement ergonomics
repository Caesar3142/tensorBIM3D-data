## TV placement ergonomics ##

TV placement ergonomics in a living room focuses on ensuring comfortable viewing without neck or eye strain. The center of the screen should generally align with seated eye level, typically around 100–110 cm from the floor depending on sofa height. Viewing distance should be proportional to screen size, allowing clear visibility without excessive head movement. The TV should also be positioned to minimize glare from windows or lighting. Proper ergonomic placement enhances comfort, reduces fatigue, and improves the overall viewing experience.
