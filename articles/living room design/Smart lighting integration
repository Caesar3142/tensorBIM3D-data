## Smart lighting integration ##

Smart lighting integration in a living room enhances convenience, efficiency, and atmosphere by allowing lights to be controlled through mobile apps, voice commands, or automated schedules. Users can adjust brightness, color temperature, or lighting scenes to match different activities such as relaxing, watching TV, or entertaining guests. Smart systems can also integrate with motion sensors and daylight sensors to optimize energy use. This technology not only improves functionality but also adds a modern and personalized touch to the living space.
