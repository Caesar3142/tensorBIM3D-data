## Floor lamp styling ##

Floor lamp styling in a living room combines functionality with decorative impact. Placing a floor lamp next to a sofa or accent chair creates a cozy reading corner while adding vertical balance to the space. Arc floor lamps can extend over seating areas to provide focused light without requiring ceiling fixtures, making them ideal for flexible layouts. The lamp’s material, shade shape, and finish should complement the room’s overall design theme, ensuring it enhances both ambiance and visual harmony.
