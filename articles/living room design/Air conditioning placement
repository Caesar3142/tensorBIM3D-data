## Air conditioning placement ##

Air conditioning placement in a living room should ensure even airflow distribution while maintaining visual harmony. Wall-mounted split units are typically installed at a higher level to allow cool air to circulate effectively without blowing directly onto seating areas. Ceiling cassette or concealed systems provide a cleaner aesthetic and more balanced air diffusion in larger spaces. The unit should be positioned away from direct sunlight and heat sources to improve efficiency, while also allowing easy access for maintenance and proper drainage.
