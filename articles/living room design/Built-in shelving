## Built-in shelving ##

Built-in shelving in a living room adds both storage and architectural interest while keeping the space organized. Shelves can flank a focal point like a fireplace or TV area, creating symmetry and display opportunities for books, art, or decor. Materials and finishes should coordinate with cabinetry and wall treatments to maintain continuity. Adjustable shelving offers flexibility for varied items, and integrated lighting can highlight displayed objects while enhancing ambiance. Thoughtful placement ensures functionality without overwhelming the room’s layout.
