## Focal point positioning ##

Focal point positioning in a living room establishes a visual anchor that organizes the overall layout. Common focal points include a fireplace, TV wall, large window with a view, or an accent wall. Seating is typically arranged to face or frame this element, creating a sense of orientation and purpose. Proper placement ensures that the focal feature is immediately noticeable upon entering the room, enhancing visual hierarchy, balance, and spatial coherence.
