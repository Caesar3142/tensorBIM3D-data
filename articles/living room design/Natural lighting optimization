## Natural lighting optimization ##

Natural lighting optimization in a living room focuses on maximizing daylight to create a brighter, healthier, and more energy-efficient space. Large windows, sliding glass doors, or skylights help increase sunlight penetration, while sheer curtains allow light to filter in without sacrificing privacy. Light-colored walls, reflective surfaces, and strategically placed mirrors can further enhance brightness by distributing light throughout the room. Proper furniture placement also ensures that windows remain unobstructed, allowing the space to feel open, warm, and inviting throughout the day.
