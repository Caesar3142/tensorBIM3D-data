## Sofa type ##

Sofa type in a living room influences both comfort and style. Sectional sofas offer generous seating and flexibility for larger spaces, while two- or three-seat sofas work well in more compact areas. Classic designs like a tufted sofa bring a formal, traditional touch, and contemporary low-profile sofas suit modern interiors. Sofas with a chaise lounge provide relaxed lounging options, and modular pieces allow rearrangement to support different layouts. Choosing the right type depends on room size, usage patterns, and the desired aesthetic.
