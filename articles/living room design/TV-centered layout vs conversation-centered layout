## TV-centered layout vs conversation-centered layout ##

A TV-centered layout organizes furniture primarily around the television, making it the main focal point of the room. Seating is typically oriented in one direction to ensure clear viewing angles, which works well for entertainment-focused households but can reduce face-to-face interaction. In contrast, a conversation-centered layout arranges seating to face each other, promoting communication and social engagement, often with a coffee table or fireplace as the focal element. This approach creates a more intimate and interactive atmosphere. The ideal choice depends on whether the space is mainly used for media viewing or for social connection and discussion.
