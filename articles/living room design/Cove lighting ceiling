## Cove lighting ceiling ##

Cove lighting on the ceiling is an indirect lighting technique where LED strips or concealed fixtures are installed within a recessed ceiling detail to cast light upward or along the perimeter. This creates a soft, diffused glow that enhances the room’s ambiance without harsh glare. It is commonly used to emphasize ceiling height, add visual depth, and create a warm, elegant atmosphere. Cove lighting works well as ambient lighting and can be combined with other light sources to achieve a balanced and layered living room design.
