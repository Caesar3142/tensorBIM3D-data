## Cross ventilation strategy ##

A cross ventilation strategy in a living room improves natural airflow by positioning openings such as windows or doors on opposite or adjacent walls. This setup allows fresh air to enter from one side and exit from the other, creating continuous air movement that enhances thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Incorporating operable windows, sliding doors, or ventilated openings at different heights can further optimize airflow. Proper furniture placement is also important to avoid blocking air paths, ensuring the space remains cool, fresh, and energy efficient.
