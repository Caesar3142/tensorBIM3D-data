## Living room with double-height ceiling ##

A living room with a double-height ceiling creates a dramatic and spacious atmosphere, enhancing natural light and visual impact. The extended vertical space allows for large windows, statement lighting fixtures, or feature walls that draw the eye upward and emphasize architectural grandeur. To maintain balance and avoid an empty feel, elements such as tall curtains, layered lighting, artwork, or mezzanine views can help visually connect upper and lower levels. This design approach adds elegance and openness while still requiring thoughtful furniture scaling to ensure the space feels comfortable and proportionate.
