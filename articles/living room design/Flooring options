## Flooring options ##

Living room flooring options vary based on style, comfort, and maintenance needs. Hardwood or engineered wood offers timeless warmth and elegance, while tiles provide durability and ease of cleaning, especially in warm climates. Luxury vinyl planks mimic wood or stone with high resilience and water resistance. Area rugs can be layered over hard floors to add softness, acoustical comfort, and visual zoning. The best choice balances aesthetics, function, and lifestyle preferences.
