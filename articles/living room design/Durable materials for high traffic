## Durable materials for high traffic ##

Durable materials for high-traffic living rooms help maintain appearance and performance over time. For flooring, options like hardwood with a tough finish, ceramic or porcelain tile, and luxury vinyl planks resist wear and scratches. Upholstery in performance fabrics such as tightly woven textiles, leather, or stain-resistant synthetics stands up well to frequent use. Durable wall finishes like washable paints and resilient cabinet surfaces like laminate or solid wood help keep the space looking fresh even with daily activity. Choosing robust materials ensures longevity while still supporting the room’s style.
