## Acoustic panel placement ##

Acoustic panel placement in a living room should target areas where sound reflections are strongest to effectively reduce echo and improve clarity. Panels are commonly installed on walls opposite windows, behind sofas, or around the TV wall where sound tends to bounce. Positioning panels at ear level enhances performance, especially in conversation or media zones. Ceiling-mounted panels can also help in rooms with high ceilings. Thoughtful placement ensures better acoustic comfort while maintaining a clean and balanced interior design.
