## Layered lighting (ambient, task, accent) ##

Layered lighting in a living room combines ambient, task, and accent lighting to create a balanced and versatile atmosphere. Ambient lighting provides overall illumination through ceiling fixtures, recessed lights, or cove lighting to ensure general visibility. Task lighting, such as floor lamps or table lamps, supports specific activities like reading or working. Accent lighting highlights architectural details, artwork, or textured walls to add depth and visual interest. By integrating these three layers, the living room becomes more functional, comfortable, and visually dynamic.
