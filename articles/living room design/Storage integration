## Storage integration ##

Storage integration in a living room ensures clutter-free living while enhancing functionality and style. This can include built-in cabinetry, floating shelves, multi-functional furniture with hidden compartments, or storage benches that blend seamlessly with the overall design. Thoughtful placement near seating and entry points helps keep everyday items organized, while coordinated materials and finishes maintain a cohesive look. Well-integrated storage supports a clean, comfortable space without interrupting circulation or visual flow.
