## Dimming systems ##

Dimming systems in a living room allow adjustable light levels to suit different moods and activities. By controlling brightness through wall dimmer switches or smart lighting systems, the space can transition from bright and functional during the day to soft and relaxing in the evening. Dimmable LED fixtures are energy-efficient and compatible with layered lighting strategies, helping to fine-tune ambient, task, and accent lighting. This flexibility enhances comfort, visual balance, and overall atmosphere within the living room.
