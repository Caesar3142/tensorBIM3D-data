## Furniture scale vs room size ##

Furniture scale versus room size is essential for achieving visual balance and functional comfort in a living room. Oversized sofas or bulky pieces can overwhelm a small space and restrict circulation, while furniture that is too small may feel lost in a large room. The proportions of sofas, tables, and cabinets should align with ceiling height, floor area, and overall layout. Selecting appropriately scaled pieces ensures smooth movement, comfortable spacing, and a harmonious spatial composition.
