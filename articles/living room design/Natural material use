## Natural material use ##

Natural material use in a living room enhances warmth, texture, and connection to the environment. Materials such as solid wood, stone, rattan, linen, cotton, and wool introduce organic character and subtle variation in tone and grain. These elements create a balanced and calming atmosphere while adding durability and timeless appeal. When combined thoughtfully, natural finishes contribute to a comfortable, grounded space that feels both elegant and inviting.
