## Glare control ##

Glare control in a living room focuses on reducing excessive brightness from sunlight or artificial lighting to maintain visual comfort. Window treatments such as sheer curtains, blinds, or layered drapery help filter direct sunlight while still allowing natural light to enter. Proper placement of lighting fixtures and the use of diffused bulbs or lampshades can minimize harsh reflections and eye strain. Thoughtful furniture orientation, especially for TV placement, also prevents screen glare and ensures a more comfortable and balanced environment.
