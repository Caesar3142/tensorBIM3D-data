## Built-in cabinet material ##

Built-in cabinet material choices significantly influence both style and durability in a living room. Natural wood or wood veneer adds warmth and timeless appeal, while high-gloss lacquer or painted finishes create a sleek, contemporary look. Materials like MDF with laminate offer budget-friendly options, and accents in glass or metal can elevate modern designs. Selecting materials that complement flooring, wall finishes, and overall interior style ensures the cabinetry feels cohesive and contributes to both function and aesthetics.
