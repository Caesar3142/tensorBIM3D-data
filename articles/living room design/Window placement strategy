## Window placement strategy ##

A window placement strategy in a living room focuses on balancing natural light, views, ventilation, and furniture layout. Positioning windows along major exterior walls or at corners can maximize daylight penetration and create a stronger visual connection to the outdoors. Floor-to-ceiling windows enhance openness and emphasize vertical space, while strategically placed side windows can improve cross ventilation. Careful planning ensures that windows do not interfere with key furniture arrangements, allowing the room to remain functional, comfortable, and visually harmonious.
