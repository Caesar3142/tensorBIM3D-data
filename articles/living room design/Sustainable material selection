## Sustainable material selection ##

Sustainable material selection for a living room focuses on choosing eco-friendly, low-impact options that are healthy for both people and the planet. This can include responsibly sourced wood, bamboo, or cork for flooring and furniture; recycled or reclaimed materials for shelving, tables, and décor; and natural fiber textiles like cotton, jute, or wool for rugs and upholstery. Low-VOC paints and finishes improve indoor air quality, while durable, recyclable materials extend the life of furnishings and reduce waste. Thoughtful sustainable choices help create a beautiful, comfortable space with a smaller environmental footprint.
