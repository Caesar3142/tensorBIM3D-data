## Coffee table clearance ##

Coffee table clearance in a living room is important for both comfort and smooth circulation. A typical recommended distance between the sofa and coffee table is about 40 to 45 cm, allowing easy reach while maintaining legroom. Main walking paths around the seating area should ideally have at least 60 to 75 cm of clearance to ensure comfortable movement. Proper spacing helps the layout feel open, functional, and well-proportioned.
