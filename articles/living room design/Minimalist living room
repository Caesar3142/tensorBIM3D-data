## Minimalist living room ##

A minimalist living room emphasizes simplicity, clean lines, and a clutter-free environment to create a calm and balanced atmosphere. The design typically features neutral color palettes, functional furniture with simple forms, and carefully selected decorative elements. Open space plays an important role, allowing the room to feel airy and organized. By focusing on quality over quantity and maintaining visual harmony, a minimalist living room promotes comfort, clarity, and timeless elegance.
