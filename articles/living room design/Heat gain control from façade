## Heat gain control from façade ##

Heat gain control from the façade is crucial in maintaining a comfortable living room environment and reducing cooling loads. Strategies include installing horizontal overhangs, vertical fins, or adjustable louvers to block direct solar radiation, especially on west- and east-facing walls. High-performance glazing and reflective or low-emissivity glass can further limit heat transfer while preserving natural light. Using light-colored exterior finishes and incorporating greenery such as shading trees also helps reduce surface heat absorption. Together, these measures improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency.
