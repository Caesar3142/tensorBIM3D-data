## Insulation considerations ##

Insulation considerations in a living room are essential for maintaining thermal comfort and energy efficiency. Proper wall and ceiling insulation helps reduce heat transfer, keeping the space cooler in hot climates and warmer in cold conditions. Double-glazed windows improve thermal performance while also minimizing external noise. Attention to sealing gaps around doors, windows, and electrical outlets further prevents air leakage. Well-designed insulation not only enhances comfort but also lowers energy consumption and long-term utility costs.
