## Outdoor seating extension ##

An outdoor seating extension expands the living room beyond its interior boundaries, creating a seamless indoor–outdoor experience. By aligning floor levels, materials, and furniture styles, the terrace or patio can feel like a natural continuation of the main seating area. Sliding or folding glass doors enhance connectivity, allowing flexible use for gatherings or relaxation. Weather-resistant furniture, shading elements, and subtle lighting ensure comfort while maintaining visual harmony with the indoor space.
