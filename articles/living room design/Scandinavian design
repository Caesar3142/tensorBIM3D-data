## Scandinavian design ##

A Scandinavian design living room combines simplicity, comfort, and functionality to create a bright and welcoming space. It typically features white or soft neutral walls, light wood flooring or furniture, and clean-lined sofas that enhance the sense of openness. Natural light is maximized, often complemented by sheer curtains and minimal window treatments. Textures such as knitted throws, soft rugs, and cushions add warmth, reflecting the concept of coziness while maintaining a clean and uncluttered aesthetic.
