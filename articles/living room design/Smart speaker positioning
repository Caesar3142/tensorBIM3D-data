## Smart speaker positioning ##

Smart speaker positioning in a living room should balance sound performance, voice recognition, and aesthetics. Placing the speaker at ear level on a shelf or side table helps ensure clear audio distribution and accurate voice command detection. It should be positioned away from corners or enclosed cabinets to prevent sound distortion, and not too close to TVs or other speakers to avoid interference. Central placement within the main seating area enhances responsiveness while maintaining a clean and integrated look within the interior design.
