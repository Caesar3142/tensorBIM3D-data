## Daylight penetration strategy ##

A daylight penetration strategy in a living room focuses on maximizing natural light depth and distribution throughout the space. This can be achieved through large windows, clerestory openings, or skylights that allow sunlight to reach deeper areas. Light-colored walls, reflective surfaces, and minimal window obstructions help bounce and diffuse light evenly. Proper orientation and shading control prevent glare and overheating while maintaining brightness. Thoughtful daylight planning enhances visual comfort, reduces energy use, and creates a more uplifting atmosphere.
