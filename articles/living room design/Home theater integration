## Home theater integration ##

Home theater integration in a living room combines visual, acoustic, and spatial planning to create an immersive entertainment experience without compromising everyday comfort. The media wall can conceal wiring, speakers, and storage to maintain a clean aesthetic, while seating is arranged to optimize viewing angles and sound distribution. Acoustic treatments, layered lighting with dimming control, and glare management enhance performance. By blending technology seamlessly into the design, the living room remains functional for daily use while delivering a cinematic atmosphere when needed.
