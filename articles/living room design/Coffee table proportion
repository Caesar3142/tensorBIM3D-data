## Coffee table proportion ##

Coffee table proportion in a living room should relate closely to the size and layout of the seating area. Ideally, the table length is about two-thirds of the sofa length to maintain visual balance. The height should be similar to or slightly lower than the sofa seat height for comfort and accessibility. Adequate clearance, typically around 40–45 cm, should be maintained between the table and surrounding seating to allow easy movement. Proper proportion ensures both functionality and harmonious spatial composition.
