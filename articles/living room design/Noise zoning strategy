## Noise zoning strategy ##

A noise zoning strategy in a living room organizes the space to manage sound levels and reduce disturbance between different activity areas. Louder functions such as a TV or entertainment zone can be positioned away from quieter areas like reading corners or adjacent bedrooms. Soft elements such as rugs, upholstered furniture, and curtains help absorb sound within each zone. In open-plan layouts, partial partitions, shelving units, or furniture arrangement can subtly separate spaces while controlling sound spread. This approach improves acoustic comfort without fully enclosing the room.
