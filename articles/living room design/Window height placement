## Window height placement ##

Window height placement in a living room affects natural light distribution, privacy, ventilation, and overall spatial perception. Higher windows or clerestory windows allow daylight to penetrate deeper into the room while maintaining privacy and wall space for furniture. Standard sill heights provide balanced outdoor views and functional ventilation, while floor-to-ceiling windows maximize light and create a strong indoor–outdoor connection. The chosen height should consider furniture layout, external views, and climate conditions to achieve both comfort and visual harmony.
