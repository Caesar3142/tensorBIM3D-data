## Sofa-to-TV distance ##

Sofa-to-TV distance should be proportional to the screen size to ensure comfortable viewing without eye strain. A common guideline is to sit at a distance of about 1.5 to 2.5 times the TV’s diagonal screen size, depending on resolution. For example, a 55-inch TV is typically best viewed from around 2 to 3 meters away. Proper distance improves image clarity, reduces neck movement, and enhances the overall viewing experience in the living room.
