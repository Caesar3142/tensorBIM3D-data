## Ceiling treatment ##

Ceiling treatment in a living room enhances both visual interest and architectural character. Options include coffered or tray ceilings to add depth, exposed wood beams for warmth and texture, painted or plastered smooth finishes for a clean modern look, or integrated lighting details like recessed or cove lighting for ambiance. The choice should complement the overall design theme while considering scale and proportions to ensure the ceiling contributes to a cohesive and inviting space.
