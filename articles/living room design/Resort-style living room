## Resort-style living room ##

A resort-style living room creates a relaxing and airy atmosphere inspired by luxury vacation retreats. The design often emphasizes natural materials such as wood, rattan, linen, and stone, combined with soft neutral tones and tropical or coastal accents. Large windows, sliding doors, or open layouts help blur the boundary between indoor and outdoor spaces, enhancing natural light and views. Comfortable seating, layered textures, and subtle decorative elements contribute to a calm, refreshing environment that feels both elegant and inviting.
