## Contemporary luxury ##

A contemporary luxury living room blends modern design principles with refined materials and sophisticated detailing. The space often features clean lines, high-end finishes such as marble, glass, or polished metals, and carefully curated statement pieces like sculptural lighting or designer furniture. Neutral tones are commonly used as a base, enhanced by subtle contrasts and layered textures to create depth and elegance. The overall atmosphere feels spacious, polished, and comfortable, emphasizing quality, balance, and understated opulence.
