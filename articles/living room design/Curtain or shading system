## Curtain or shading system ##

A curtain or shading system in a living room plays an important role in controlling light, privacy, and heat gain while enhancing the overall design. Sheer curtains allow natural light to filter softly into the space, creating a bright and airy atmosphere, while heavier drapes provide better insulation and privacy when needed. Roller blinds or layered curtain systems offer flexibility by combining both functions. Selecting appropriate materials, colors, and mounting height helps achieve visual balance, improve thermal comfort, and complement the room’s interior style.
