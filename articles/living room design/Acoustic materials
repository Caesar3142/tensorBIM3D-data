## Acoustic materials ##

Acoustic materials in a living room help improve sound quality and reduce noise reverberation for a more comfortable environment. Soft furnishings like fabric sofas, heavy curtains, and area rugs naturally absorb sound, while purpose-built acoustic panels, textured wall coverings, or ceiling baffles can target echoes and reduce overall noise levels. Bookshelves filled with objects also help scatter sound. Combining these elements enhances both auditory comfort and spatial warmth without compromising the room’s aesthetic.
