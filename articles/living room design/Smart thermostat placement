## Smart thermostat placement ##

Smart thermostat placement in a living room should ensure accurate temperature sensing and convenient access. It is best installed on an interior wall at about eye level, away from direct sunlight, windows, doors, air vents, or heat-producing appliances that could distort readings. Central positioning within the main living zone helps reflect the average room temperature. Proper placement improves energy efficiency, maintains consistent comfort, and supports effective integration with heating and cooling systems.
