## Courtyard-facing living room ##

A courtyard-facing living room creates a private and serene focal point by orienting the main space toward an internal garden or open-air courtyard. Large glass panels or sliding doors frame the courtyard view, bringing in natural light while maintaining privacy from the street. This layout enhances cross ventilation and strengthens the connection to greenery without sacrificing security. The result is a calm, naturally lit environment that feels open yet protected, ideal for relaxation and intimate gatherings.
