## Indoor plant integration ##

Indoor plant integration in a living room enhances both aesthetics and well-being by introducing natural texture, color, and freshness. Large floor plants can anchor empty corners, while smaller potted plants on shelves or coffee tables add layered greenery. Hanging planters or plant stands help vary height and create visual balance. Beyond decoration, plants can contribute to improved air quality and a calming atmosphere, making the space feel more vibrant and connected to nature.
