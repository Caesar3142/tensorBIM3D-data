## Carpet for sound absorption ##

Carpet for sound absorption is an effective way to reduce noise and improve acoustics in a living room. Thick carpets or area rugs, especially with dense fibers and quality underlay padding, help absorb airborne sounds and minimize echoes. This soft surface dampens footstep noise and prevents sound from bouncing off hard floors, creating a quieter, more comfortable space. Layering rugs or pairing them with soft furnishings further enhances acoustic performance while adding warmth and style to the room.
