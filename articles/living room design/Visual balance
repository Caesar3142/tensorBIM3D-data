## Visual balance ##

Visual balance in a living room refers to the harmonious distribution of visual weight among furniture, colors, textures, and architectural elements. This can be achieved through symmetrical arrangements for a formal and orderly look, or asymmetrical compositions for a more dynamic and modern feel. Balancing large and small pieces, light and dark tones, and solid and textured surfaces helps prevent the space from feeling too heavy on one side. Thoughtful visual balance creates a cohesive, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing environment.
