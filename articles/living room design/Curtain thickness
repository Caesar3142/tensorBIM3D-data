## Curtain thickness ##

Curtain thickness in a living room affects light control, privacy, insulation, and acoustic comfort. Heavier, thicker curtains (such as blackout or layered drapery) block more sunlight and help reduce heat gain or loss, while also dampening outside noise and minimizing echoes. Medium-weight fabrics allow soft, diffused light while offering some privacy and sound control. Pairing thick curtains with sheer layers gives flexibility: sheers for gentle daylight and thick panels when you want darkness, insulation, and better sound absorption. Choosing the right thickness balances functionality with the desired ambiance.
