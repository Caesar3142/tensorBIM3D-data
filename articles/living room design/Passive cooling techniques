## Passive cooling techniques ##

Passive cooling techniques in a living room focus on reducing heat gain and enhancing natural comfort without relying heavily on mechanical systems. Strategies include cross ventilation through well-placed windows, shading devices such as overhangs or blinds to block direct sunlight, and the use of light-colored materials that reflect heat. High ceilings and ventilated openings can help release warm air, while indoor plants contribute to improved air quality and a cooler atmosphere. Thoughtful design integration of these elements promotes energy efficiency and a more sustainable living environment.
