## Security camera placement ##

Security camera placement in a living room should ensure broad coverage while remaining discreet and respectful of privacy. Cameras are typically mounted at higher corners or near the ceiling to capture a wide field of view without being easily tampered with. Positioning near entry points such as doors or large windows enhances monitoring effectiveness. Proper angle adjustment avoids direct glare from windows or lights, and concealed wiring maintains a clean interior appearance while supporting reliable surveillance.
