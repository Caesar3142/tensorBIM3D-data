## Echo control ##

Echo control in a living room focuses on reducing unwanted sound reflections to create a more comfortable acoustic environment. This can be achieved through soft furnishings like rugs, upholstered sofas, and heavy curtains that absorb sound. Purpose-built acoustic panels or textured wall treatments also help break up and dampen sound waves. Bookshelves with varied objects scatter noise, and ceiling baffles or fabric panels can further minimize reverberation, resulting in clearer, quieter spaces ideal for conversation and media use.
