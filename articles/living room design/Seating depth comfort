## Seating depth comfort ##

Seating depth comfort in a living room depends on how the sofa supports the back and legs during use. A standard comfortable seat depth typically ranges from about 50 to 60 cm for upright sitting, while deeper seats around 60 to 70 cm offer a more relaxed, lounge-style experience. The right depth should allow the user’s feet to rest flat on the floor with proper back support. Selecting appropriate seating depth enhances posture, reduces fatigue, and improves overall comfort.
