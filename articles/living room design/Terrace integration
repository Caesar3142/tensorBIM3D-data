## Terrace integration ##

Terrace integration in a living room strengthens the indoor–outdoor relationship by creating a fluid transition between interior space and the exterior terrace. Large sliding or folding glass doors help visually and physically connect the two areas, allowing natural light and fresh air to flow inside. Consistent flooring materials, complementary color palettes, and coordinated furniture styles enhance continuity. This integration expands usable living space, supports social gatherings, and fosters a relaxed, open atmosphere.
