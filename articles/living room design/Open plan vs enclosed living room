## Open plan vs enclosed living room ##

An open plan living room creates a spacious and connected atmosphere by blending seamlessly with dining or kitchen areas, allowing better natural light flow and easier social interaction. This layout is ideal for modern lifestyles and entertaining, as it promotes flexibility and visual continuity. In contrast, an enclosed living room offers greater privacy, better sound control, and a more defined, intimate environment. It can feel cozier and more focused, especially for relaxation or formal gatherings. The choice between open and enclosed layouts depends on lifestyle preferences, noise considerations, and the desired level of separation within the home.
