## Integrated control panel ##

An integrated control panel in a living room centralizes the management of lighting, climate, audio, security, and shading systems into one interface. Typically wall-mounted at an accessible height, it provides convenient touch-screen or button control for multiple smart home functions. Proper placement near main circulation areas ensures ease of use without disrupting the interior design. When seamlessly integrated with the wall finish, the control panel enhances both functionality and the modern aesthetic of the space.
