## Seating configuration (L-shape, U-shape, parallel) ##

Seating configuration influences both comfort and interaction within a living room. An L-shape layout is effective for utilizing corner areas and creating a relaxed, conversational setting while maintaining openness. A U-shape arrangement suits larger spaces, providing generous seating and a more enclosed, cozy atmosphere around a central focal point. A parallel configuration, where two sofas or chairs face each other, offers a balanced and often more formal look that encourages direct conversation. The best choice depends on the room size, focal point, and how the space is intended to be used.
