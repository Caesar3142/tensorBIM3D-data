## Child-safe furniture ##

Child-safe furniture in a living room focuses on minimizing hazards while maintaining comfort and style. Look for pieces with rounded edges and corners to reduce injury risk, stable and sturdy frames that won’t tip easily, and non-toxic, easy-clean materials that withstand spills and wear. Anchoring tall furniture to walls prevents tipping, and choosing low profile seating can make the space more accessible for kids. Thoughtful selections create a safer environment without compromising the room’s overall design.
