## Living room connected to kitchen ##

A living room connected to the kitchen creates an open and interactive space that supports modern living and social engagement. This layout allows conversations to flow easily between cooking and relaxing areas, making it ideal for families and entertaining guests. To maintain organization, subtle zoning strategies such as kitchen islands, different flooring materials, or lighting variations can help define each function without closing off the space. Proper ventilation and thoughtful layout planning are also important to manage noise and cooking odors while preserving a comfortable and cohesive atmosphere.
