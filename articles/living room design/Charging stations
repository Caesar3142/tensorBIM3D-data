## Charging stations ##

Charging stations in a living room provide convenient and organized access to power for phones, tablets, and other devices. They can be integrated into side tables, built-in cabinets, or drawers with concealed outlets and USB ports to maintain a tidy appearance. Wall outlets with USB-C or smart charging features also reduce clutter from adapters. Thoughtful placement near seating areas ensures accessibility while hidden cable routing preserves a clean and streamlined interior.
