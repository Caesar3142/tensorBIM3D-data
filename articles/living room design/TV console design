## TV console design ##

TV console design in a living room balances function and style by providing a stable, visually appealing base for the television and related media. Options range from low-profile consoles that keep the sightline open to floating units that enhance a modern, airy feel. Integrated storage helps organize devices, cables, and accessories, while material choices—such as wood, metal, or lacquer finishes—can complement the overall interior theme. The console height should align with comfortable viewing angles, and its width ideally spans close to the width of the TV for a cohesive look.
