## Flexible layout for multipurpose use ##

A flexible layout for multipurpose use allows the living room to adapt easily to different activities such as relaxing, working, entertaining, or hosting guests. This approach often incorporates modular sofas, lightweight chairs, ottomans, or foldable tables that can be rearranged as needed. Clear circulation paths and minimal fixed elements help maintain openness while supporting various configurations. By prioritizing adaptability and smart furniture choices, the space remains functional, comfortable, and efficient for changing daily needs.
