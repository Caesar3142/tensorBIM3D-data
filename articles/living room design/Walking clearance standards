## Walking clearance standards ##

Walking clearance standards in a living room ensure comfortable movement and safe circulation around furniture. For primary pathways—such as between the sofa and entry or past major seating areas—aim for at least about 75 cm (30 inches) of clear space. Secondary circulation zones, like between chairs or side tables, can function well with around 60 cm (24 inches). Maintaining these minimum clearances helps avoid congestion, supports accessibility, and contributes to a relaxed and functional layout.
