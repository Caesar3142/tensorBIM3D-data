## Pet-friendly furniture ##

Pet-friendly furniture in a living room prioritizes durability, easy cleaning, and comfort for both people and pets. Look for sofas or chairs upholstered in tightly woven, stain-resistant fabrics, removable or washable covers, and materials that resist scratching. Leather and performance textiles are popular choices, and low-pile rugs or washable area rugs help manage fur and spills. Rounded edges and sturdy frames also make the space safer and more practical for pets while keeping the overall design inviting and functional.
