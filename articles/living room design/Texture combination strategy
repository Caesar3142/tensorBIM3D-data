## Texture combination strategy ##

A texture combination strategy in a living room focuses on layering different materials to create depth and visual interest. Mixing smooth surfaces like glass or polished metal with warmer elements such as wood, fabric, or natural fibers adds balance and contrast. Soft textiles like rugs, cushions, and throws can offset harder finishes, making the space feel more inviting. Thoughtful coordination of rough, smooth, matte, and glossy textures enhances richness while maintaining harmony within the overall design concept.
