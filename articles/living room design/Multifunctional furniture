## Multifunctional furniture ##

Multifunctional furniture in a living room maximizes usability and efficiency, especially in flexible or compact spaces. Pieces like sofa beds, storage ottomans, nesting tables, or coffee tables with built-in storage serve dual purposes, reducing clutter and adapting to different activities. Modular seating can be reconfigured for lounging, entertaining, or even a temporary guest bed. By combining function with thoughtful design, multifunctional furniture enhances comfort and versatility without sacrificing style.
