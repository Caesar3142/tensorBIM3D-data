## Window sill height ##

Window sill height in a living room affects views, furniture placement, and overall comfort. A common interior sill height ranges from about 75 to 90 cm from the floor, allowing clear outdoor views while maintaining safety and wall usability. Lower sill heights create a stronger visual connection to the outside and enhance natural light, while higher sills provide more privacy and wall space for furniture placement. The ideal height should balance view quality, interior layout, and local building standards.
