## Ceiling fan positioning ##

Ceiling fan positioning in a living room should prioritize both airflow efficiency and visual balance. Ideally, the fan is centered within the main seating area to distribute air evenly throughout the space. In larger or open-plan layouts, multiple fans may be required to maintain consistent circulation. For double-height ceilings, a downrod extension helps position the fan at an effective height for optimal airflow. Proper clearance from walls and furniture ensures safety while maximizing comfort and ventilation performance.
