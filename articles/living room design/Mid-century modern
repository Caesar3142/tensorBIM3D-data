## Mid-century modern ##

A mid-century modern living room is defined by clean lines, organic forms, and functional design inspired by the 1950s and 1960s. Furniture typically features tapered legs, simple silhouettes, and warm wood finishes such as teak or walnut. The color palette often combines neutral tones with bold accent colors like mustard, teal, or burnt orange. Minimal ornamentation and an emphasis on practicality create a space that feels timeless, stylish, and comfortably modern.
