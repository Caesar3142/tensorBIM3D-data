## Natural ventilation flow ##

Natural ventilation flow in a living room relies on strategic placement of openings to encourage continuous air movement. Windows or doors positioned on opposite or adjacent walls allow fresh air to enter and exit, creating cross ventilation. Varying opening heights can further enhance airflow by allowing warm air to rise and escape while cooler air enters below. Proper furniture arrangement ensures that air paths remain unobstructed, improving indoor comfort, air quality, and energy efficiency without heavy reliance on mechanical systems.
