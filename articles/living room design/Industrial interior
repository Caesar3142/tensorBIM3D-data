## Industrial interior ##

An industrial interior living room is defined by raw textures, structural elements, and a bold, urban character. Common features include exposed brick walls, concrete surfaces, visible beams, and metal accents that highlight the building’s architectural framework. Furniture often combines wood and steel with clean, sturdy forms, while neutral tones such as gray, black, and brown dominate the palette. Soft furnishings like rugs and cushions are typically added to balance the rugged materials, creating a space that feels both edgy and comfortable.
