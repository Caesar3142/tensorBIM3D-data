## Speaker placement ##

Speaker placement in a living room should ensure balanced sound distribution and clear audio imaging. Front left and right speakers are typically positioned at ear level on either side of the TV, angled slightly toward the seating area. The center speaker is placed directly above or below the screen to anchor dialogue to the image. Surround or rear speakers are positioned slightly behind and to the sides of the main seating area to create immersive sound. Proper spacing and alignment enhance clarity, depth, and overall listening experience.
