## Wall finishing ##

Living room wall finishing plays a key role in defining the room’s character, texture, and overall ambiance. Options range from smooth painted surfaces in neutral tones to textured finishes, decorative panels, wood cladding, or stone accents that create visual depth. An accent wall can serve as a focal point, adding contrast and personality without overwhelming the space. The choice of material and color should complement the furniture, lighting, and overall interior concept while ensuring durability and ease of maintenance.
