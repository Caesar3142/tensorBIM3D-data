## Stack ventilation concept ##

The stack ventilation concept in a living room uses the natural principle that warm air rises to improve airflow and cooling. By placing lower openings such as windows or doors for air intake and higher openings like clerestory windows, vents, or skylights for exhaust, warm air can escape while cooler air is drawn in from below. This vertical air movement is especially effective in double-height spaces, where temperature differences enhance airflow. Proper design ensures better thermal comfort, reduced reliance on mechanical cooling, and improved indoor air quality.
