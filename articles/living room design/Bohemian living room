## Bohemian living room ##

A Bohemian living room embraces an eclectic and free-spirited aesthetic filled with color, texture, and personality. The space often features layered rugs, patterned cushions, woven elements, and a mix of vintage or handcrafted furniture. Earthy tones are commonly paired with vibrant accents, while indoor plants add freshness and a natural touch. Rather than strict symmetry, this style celebrates creative expression and relaxed comfort, resulting in a warm, inviting, and visually rich environment.
