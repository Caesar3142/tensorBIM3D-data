## Furniture arrangement strategies ##

This living room design uses smart furniture arrangement strategies to create a balanced and functional space. The seating is positioned to encourage conversation, typically centered around a focal point such as a coffee table, TV, or fireplace, while maintaining clear circulation paths for easy movement. Larger pieces like sofas anchor the room, and accent chairs or side tables add flexibility without overcrowding the layout. The arrangement also considers proportion and symmetry, ensuring the space feels cohesive, open, and comfortable for both daily living and entertaining guests.
