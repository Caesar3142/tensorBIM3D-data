## Living room facing garden ##

A living room facing the garden creates a strong indoor–outdoor connection, enhancing natural light, views, and overall tranquility. Large windows or sliding glass doors frame greenery as a natural backdrop, making the space feel more open and expansive. Furniture can be oriented toward the garden to maximize the view, while neutral tones and natural materials help visually blend interior and exterior environments. This layout promotes relaxation, improves daylight quality, and strengthens the sense of harmony with nature.
