## Japandi style ##

A Japandi style living room blends Japanese minimalism with Scandinavian warmth, creating a calm, functional, and harmonious space. The design emphasizes clean lines, low-profile furniture, natural wood tones, and a muted color palette of beige, soft gray, and earthy hues. Clutter is minimized, while carefully chosen decor elements such as ceramics, textured fabrics, and indoor plants add subtle character. The overall atmosphere feels serene and balanced, combining simplicity with comfort and craftsmanship.
