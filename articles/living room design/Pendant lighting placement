## Pendant lighting placement ##

Pendant lighting placement in a living room should consider function, proportion, and visual balance. Pendants are often positioned above a coffee table, side table, or in a corner seating area to create a focal point and provide localized illumination. The hanging height should allow comfortable clearance while maintaining visual connection to the furniture below, typically low enough to define the zone but high enough to avoid obstructing views. In larger spaces, multiple pendants or clustered designs can help distribute light evenly and enhance the overall composition of the room.
