## Circulation flow (minimum walking clearance) ##

Good circulation flow in a living room design ensures that people can move comfortably without feeling cramped or blocked by furniture. A minimum walking clearance of about 60–75 cm (24–30 inches) is typically recommended for main pathways, while secondary paths can function with slightly less space if necessary. Maintaining clear routes between seating areas, doorways, and focal points helps the room feel open and functional. Proper circulation planning not only improves comfort and safety but also enhances the overall visual balance of the space.
