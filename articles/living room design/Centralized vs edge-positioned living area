## Centralized vs edge-positioned living area ##

A centralized living area is positioned at the heart of the home, making it easily accessible from multiple rooms and encouraging interaction and connectivity. This layout often becomes the main social hub, ideal for family gatherings and shared activities. In contrast, an edge-positioned living area is located along the perimeter of the house, often benefiting from better views, natural light, or privacy. While it may feel calmer and more secluded, it can also be slightly detached from the main circulation flow. The choice depends on whether the priority is central interaction or a quieter, view-oriented setting.
