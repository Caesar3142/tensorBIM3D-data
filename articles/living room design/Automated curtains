## Automated curtains ##

Automated curtains in a living room enhance comfort, convenience, and energy efficiency by allowing users to control natural light and privacy through remote controls, wall switches, or smart home apps. They can be programmed to open and close based on time of day, sunlight levels, or occupancy, helping regulate heat gain and reduce glare. Motorized systems also improve accessibility in spaces with high ceilings or large windows. Integrated with smart home platforms, automated curtains contribute to a seamless and modern living environment.
