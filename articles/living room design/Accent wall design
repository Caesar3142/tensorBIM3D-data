## Accent wall design ##

Accent wall design in a living room creates a focal point that adds depth and character without overwhelming the space. This can be achieved through contrasting paint colors, textured finishes, wood slats, stone cladding, wallpaper, or decorative panels. The accent wall is often positioned behind a sofa or TV unit to anchor the layout visually. When designed thoughtfully, it enhances spatial interest, complements the overall interior theme, and brings balance between boldness and harmony.
