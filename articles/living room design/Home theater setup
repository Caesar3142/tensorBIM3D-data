## Home theater setup ##

A home theater setup in a living room combines optimal screen placement, balanced seating layout, and proper speaker positioning to create an immersive viewing experience. The TV or projector screen should be positioned at eye level with comfortable viewing distance based on screen size. Surround sound speakers are ideally arranged to distribute audio evenly, with front speakers near the screen and rear speakers slightly behind the seating area. Managing glare through curtains and incorporating acoustic treatments enhances both picture clarity and sound quality, resulting in a cinematic yet comfortable environment.
