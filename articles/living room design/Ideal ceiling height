## Ideal ceiling height ##

The ideal ceiling height for a living room depends on the desired spatial experience and architectural style. A standard comfortable height is around 2.7 to 3 meters, which provides good air circulation and a balanced sense of openness. Higher ceilings, such as 3.2 meters or more, create a more spacious and luxurious feel, while double-height ceilings dramatically enhance light and vertical volume. The appropriate height should align with room proportions, ventilation strategy, and overall design intent to ensure both comfort and visual harmony.
