## Soundproofing from outside noise ##

Soundproofing from outside noise helps make a living room quieter and more comfortable. Effective strategies include installing double- or triple-glazed windows and solid core doors to block sound transmission. Adding acoustic insulation inside walls, ceilings, or floors reduces airborne and impact noise. Seal gaps around windows and doors with weatherstripping or acoustic seals to prevent sound leaks. Combined with heavy curtains and soft furnishings, these measures significantly improve noise reduction while maintaining visual comfort.
