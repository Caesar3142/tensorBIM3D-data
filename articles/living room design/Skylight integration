## Skylight integration ##

Skylight integration in a living room enhances natural lighting by introducing daylight from above, creating a brighter and more open atmosphere. Positioned strategically, skylights can evenly distribute light deeper into the space while maintaining privacy from neighboring buildings. They also highlight architectural features and add a dynamic quality as light changes throughout the day. Proper insulation, glazing selection, and shading options are important to control heat gain and glare, ensuring the space remains comfortable and energy efficient.
