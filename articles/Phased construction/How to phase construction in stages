## How to phase construction in stages ##

To phase construction in stages effectively, begin by planning a master layout that anticipates future expansion so structural and utility systems can accommodate additional work later. In the first stage, complete essential components such as the foundation, primary structural frame, roof, basic plumbing, electrical systems, one bathroom, kitchen, and core living spaces to make the house fully functional. Ensure that structural elements like columns and foundations are sized for future floors or extensions to avoid costly retrofits. In the second stage, add extra bedrooms, façade upgrades, or interior finishes once budget allows. Final stages can include aesthetic improvements, landscaping, or additional floors. It is important to cap and protect future connection points for plumbing and electrical systems, and to waterproof unfinished structural elements properly. Careful upfront planning ensures each phase integrates smoothly without compromising structural safety or increasing long-term costs.
