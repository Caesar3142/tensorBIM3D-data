## Design house using modular construction ##

To design a house using modular construction, start with a standardized structural grid that allows prefabricated modules to be manufactured off-site and assembled efficiently on location. The layout should be based on repeatable rectangular units that can function independently or combine to form larger spaces such as living areas or bedrooms. Plan structural connections carefully so modules can be transported safely and joined securely, ensuring proper alignment of walls, floors, and utilities. Services like plumbing, electrical, and HVAC should be pre-installed within modules to reduce on-site work and speed up construction. The foundation must be precisely prepared to receive the modules, typically using a concrete slab or pier system. Exterior finishes and roof systems can be added after assembly to unify the appearance. By emphasizing simplicity, repeatability, and integrated services, modular construction reduces build time, minimizes waste, and maintains consistent quality while still allowing design flexibility.
