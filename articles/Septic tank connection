## Septic tank connection ##

A septic tank connection in a bathroom plumbing system links the building’s wastewater drains to an on-site septic tank for treatment and disposal. All fixtures—toilets, sinks, showers, and bathtubs—connect via a network of properly sloped drain pipes that converge toward the main soil stack, which then leads to the septic tank inlet. Pipes must be sized correctly (typically 3–4 inches or 75–100 mm for toilets and 1½–2 inches or 38–50 mm for sinks and showers) and maintain a consistent slope, usually 1/4 inch per foot for smaller pipes, to ensure smooth flow. Proper venting, backflow prevention, and sealed connections are essential to maintain the water seal, prevent odors, and ensure the septic system functions efficiently while complying with local health and building codes.
