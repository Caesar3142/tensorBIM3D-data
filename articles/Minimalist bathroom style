## Minimalist bathroom style ##

A minimalist bathroom style emphasizes simplicity, clean lines, and uncluttered spaces. Fixtures are often streamlined and functional, with wall-mounted or floating vanities, concealed storage, and frameless mirrors to reduce visual clutter. Neutral color palettes, such as whites, grays, and natural tones, dominate, sometimes accented with subtle textures or materials like stone or wood. Surfaces are smooth and easy to clean, and accessories are kept to a minimum to maintain an open, airy feel. Minimalist design also focuses on efficient layout and thoughtful lighting, creating a calm, organized, and visually pleasing bathroom environment.
