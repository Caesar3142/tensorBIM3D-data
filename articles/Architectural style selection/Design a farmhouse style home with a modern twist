## Design a farmhouse style home with a modern twist ##

A modern farmhouse style home blends the warmth and simplicity of traditional rural architecture with clean lines and contemporary functionality. The exterior can feature a classic gable roof, white board-and-batten or shiplap siding, and black-framed windows for a crisp, updated look, complemented by a welcoming front porch with simple wooden columns and metal accents. Inside, the layout should be open and airy, combining the kitchen, dining, and living areas into one spacious gathering zone with high ceilings and exposed beams. A large kitchen island, quartz or marble countertops, and minimalist cabinetry provide modern convenience while maintaining rustic charm through natural wood finishes and warm textures. Sliding barn doors can be reinterpreted in a sleek, refined way, and industrial-style lighting fixtures add subtle contrast. Neutral color palettes—whites, soft grays, and warm earth tones—paired with natural materials like wood and stone create a cozy yet sophisticated atmosphere. Large windows and glass doors connect the interior to outdoor patios or gardens, ensuring the home feels both grounded in tradition and refreshed for contemporary living.
