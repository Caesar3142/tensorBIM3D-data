## Orientation and sun exposure ##

When designing a minimalist house for a tropical climate, orient the building to minimize direct east–west sun exposure. Long façades facing north and south receive less intense solar gain than east and west. Typically, place main living areas and large windows toward the cooler orientations, and limit glazing on east and west walls where low-angle sun is hardest to control.

## Shading and overhangs ##

Use wide roof overhangs and shading devices to protect from heavy rain and intense sunlight. Overhangs of 600 to 900 mm are common for single-storey houses; deeper overhangs (1.0 to 1.2 m) work well for two-storey buildings. Shading devices reduce heat gain and glare while allowing natural light. Light-colored or reflective materials on overhangs help reflect heat away from the building.

## Cross-ventilation and airflow ##

Maximize cross-ventilation with well-placed windows and high ceilings to release hot air. Ceiling heights of 2.7 to 3.2 m improve stack effect and airflow. Place windows and openings on opposite sides of rooms to create cross-ventilation paths. Louvers and operable panels allow adjustable airflow. Avoid blocking prevailing breezes with solid walls or furniture placement.

## Materials and finishes ##

Choose breathable, heat-resistant materials such as concrete, natural stone, or treated wood. Light-colored finishes reflect heat and reduce cooling demand. Avoid dark, heat-absorbing surfaces on exteriors. Use moisture-resistant detailing for humidity and tropical storms. Concrete and stone have high thermal mass and can help stabilize indoor temperatures when combined with good ventilation.

## Indoor-outdoor integration ##

Incorporate large openings, courtyards, or semi-outdoor spaces to blend indoor and outdoor living while maintaining airflow. Courtyards of 3 to 6 m² can act as light wells and ventilation shafts. Verandas, terraces, and covered walkways extend living space and provide shaded outdoor areas. Keep the transition between inside and outside fluid to support natural ventilation and a sense of openness.

## Roof and moisture protection ##

Proper roof insulation, good drainage, and moisture-resistant detailing are essential to handle humidity and tropical storms. Roof slopes of 15° to 30° shed rain effectively. Ensure adequate gutters and downpipes. Insulate the roof to reduce radiant heat from above. Use vapor barriers and well-detailed flashing to prevent moisture ingress.

## Layout and minimalist principles ##

Keep the layout clean, functional, and uncluttered to stay true to minimalist design principles. Avoid unnecessary partitions that block airflow. Open-plan living areas work well when combined with clear zoning. Prioritize quality of space over quantity; a well-proportioned, well-ventilated room feels larger than a cramped one. Simple forms and honest materials support both aesthetics and passive cooling.
