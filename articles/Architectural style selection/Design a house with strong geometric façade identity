## Design a house with strong geometric façade identity ##

A house with a strong geometric façade identity should be conceived as a sculptural composition of bold, clean forms that immediately establish visual character. The exterior can feature intersecting volumes—cubes, rectangular prisms, or sharp triangular elements—that project and recess to create depth, shadow, and rhythm. A dynamic interplay between solid walls and precisely framed openings enhances the geometry, with windows arranged in deliberate patterns rather than conventional symmetry. Materials such as smooth concrete, metal panels, natural stone, or textured plaster in contrasting tones can emphasize each geometric mass, while vertical or horizontal fins add articulation and sun shading. A cantilevered upper floor or an angled entrance canopy can serve as a dramatic focal point. At night, integrated linear LED lighting can trace edges and planes, highlighting the architectural geometry and reinforcing the identity. The result is a visually striking home where form, proportion, and contrast define a memorable and contemporary façade presence.
