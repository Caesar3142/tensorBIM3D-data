## I want a brutalist concrete house design ##

A brutalist concrete house design emphasizes bold geometry, raw materials, and honest structural expression, creating a powerful and sculptural presence. The architecture should feature strong rectangular or cantilevered volumes, thick concrete walls, and exposed structural elements that showcase the texture of board-formed or cast-in-place concrete. Large, strategically placed openings and deep-set windows balance the heaviness of the material, allowing natural light to create dramatic shadows across the interior surfaces. The layout can be organized around a central courtyard or double-height living space, enhancing spatial contrast between solid and void. Interiors should maintain a minimalist approach with polished concrete floors, steel railings, and natural wood accents to soften the rigidity of the concrete. Built-in concrete furniture, floating staircases, and integrated lighting further reinforce the monolithic aesthetic. Landscaping with gravel, native plants, and reflecting pools complements the raw architectural language, resulting in a house that feels bold, timeless, and architecturally expressive.
