## Site Planning and Compact Layout ##

For a Japanese-inspired house under 100 m², efficiency and clarity of space are essential. Use a simple rectangular footprint to minimize wasted circulation. A two-storey layout (for example, 45–50 m² per floor) helps preserve outdoor space for a small庭 (garden) or courtyard. Carefully zone public areas (living, dining, kitchen) on the ground floor and private spaces (bedrooms) above, keeping circulation compact and intentional.

## Simplicity and Architectural Form ##

Japanese-inspired homes emphasize clean geometry, low profiles, and harmony with surroundings. Use a simple gable or gently sloped roof. Keep exterior forms understated, with neutral colors such as off-white, charcoal, or natural wood tones. The façade should feel calm and balanced rather than decorative.

## Flexible Interior Spaces ##

Incorporate multi-functional rooms to maximize space. Sliding partitions (such as shoji-style panels or modern sliding doors) allow rooms to expand or contract depending on use. A tatami-inspired room of 6–8 m² can function as a guest room, study, or meditation space. Avoid permanent walls where flexibility is beneficial.

## Natural Light and Visual Calm ##

Use carefully framed windows rather than oversized glazing. Position openings to capture soft daylight and views of greenery. Clerestory windows, small courtyards (2–4 m²), or light wells can bring brightness into the center of the house without sacrificing privacy. Light-colored walls and wood finishes help reflect natural light and enhance a sense of tranquility.

## Material Palette and Texture ##

Choose natural materials such as light wood, stone, and textured plaster. Keep the palette restrained: warm timber floors, white or beige walls, and subtle gray accents. Exposed wood beams or wooden ceilings can add warmth without visual clutter. Matte finishes are preferred to maintain a soft, organic feel.

## Indoor-Outdoor Connection ##

Create a strong relationship with nature, even on a small plot. A small庭 garden, engawa-style covered walkway, or sliding glass doors facing a planted courtyard strengthens this connection. Use simple landscaping—gravel, stepping stones, bamboo, or small trees—to create a peaceful atmosphere.

## Storage and Minimalism ##

Built-in storage is essential in a sub-100 m² home. Use concealed cabinets, under-stair storage, and wall-integrated shelving to reduce clutter. Keep furniture low and minimal. Prioritize quality over quantity—fewer, well-crafted elements enhance the calm aesthetic typical of Japanese design.

## Atmosphere and Proportion ##

Focus on human scale and proportion. Ceiling heights of around 2.4–2.7 meters feel comfortable and intimate. Use soft lighting in the evening to complement natural daylight. The goal is not only efficiency but also serenity—creating a small home that feels spacious through thoughtful design, balance, and harmony.
