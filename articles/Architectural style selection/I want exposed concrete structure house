## I want exposed concrete structure house ##

An exposed concrete structure house should celebrate raw material expression while maintaining comfort and durability. Use reinforced concrete for columns, beams, slabs, and walls, leaving selected structural elements unfinished or board-formed to highlight texture and craftsmanship. Keep the architectural form simple and geometric so the structural grid becomes part of the aesthetic language. To avoid a cold or heavy atmosphere, balance the concrete with warm materials such as natural wood, steel accents, and large glass openings that bring in daylight. Incorporate deep overhangs and recessed windows to create shadow lines that emphasize the mass and depth of the concrete. Proper waterproofing, surface sealing, and thermal insulation are essential to prevent moisture issues and improve energy performance. By carefully combining structure, light, and material contrast, the house can feel bold and sculptural while remaining comfortable for everyday living.
