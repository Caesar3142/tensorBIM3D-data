## Site Planning and Spatial Efficiency ##

On a 10 × 20 meter lot (200 m²), prioritize efficient use of space while allowing light and air to penetrate deep into the house. A building width of around 6–8 meters leaves room for small side setbacks or a narrow garden strip. A two-storey layout helps maximize usable area while preserving a backyard of at least 2–3 meters for light and ventilation. Place living spaces toward the front or facing the garden to capture the best daylight.

## Scandinavian Architectural Character ##

Scandinavian design emphasizes simplicity, clean lines, and natural materials. Use a simple rectangular massing with a pitched or low-sloped roof. The façade should feature light-colored finishes such as white, soft gray, or muted earth tones. Combine timber cladding, white render, and black or natural wood window frames for contrast while maintaining warmth and minimalism.

## Natural Lighting Strategy ##

Maximize natural light through large, well-positioned windows. Floor-to-ceiling glazing facing the backyard helps bring daylight into the main living areas. Consider tall vertical windows, corner windows, or clerestory windows to draw light deeper into the interior. A small internal light court (2–4 m²) or skylights above staircases can significantly improve brightness in the center of the house.

## Open-Plan Living Layout ##

Use an open-plan concept on the ground floor to enhance the sense of space. Combine living, dining, and kitchen areas into one continuous zone with clear visual flow. Avoid unnecessary partitions that block light. A centrally located staircase with open risers allows light to pass through and prevents visual heaviness.

## Interior Materials and Palette ##

Choose a light and natural material palette: white walls, light oak or birch wood flooring, and soft neutral textiles. Use matte finishes and natural textures to create warmth. Built-in cabinetry in white or pale wood keeps the interior uncluttered. Keep ceilings simple and bright to reflect natural light effectively.

## Connection to Nature ##

Incorporate sliding glass doors that open to the backyard or terrace to create a strong indoor-outdoor relationship. Add simple landscaping with greenery visible from main living spaces. Even a small garden or courtyard can enhance the Scandinavian emphasis on nature and daylight.

## Roof and Window Performance ##

Since Scandinavian design often features large windows, ensure good thermal performance with double glazing and proper shading for tropical or warm climates. Use light curtains or sheer blinds to diffuse sunlight while maintaining brightness. A well-insulated roof and proper ventilation maintain comfort without sacrificing natural light.

## Minimalist and Functional Living ##

Keep the layout practical and uncluttered. Include built-in storage to reduce visual noise. Maintain circulation widths of at least 900 mm for comfort in a compact footprint. Focus on quality of light, proportion, and material honesty—key elements that define a Scandinavian-style home designed around natural illumination.
