## Design a house that feels like a resort ##

A resort-style house should feel like a private sanctuary by blending indoor and outdoor living, natural materials, and open, airy spaces. The layout can center around a courtyard, pool, or landscaped garden, with large sliding glass doors that fully open to connect the living room, dining area, and kitchen to the outdoors. High ceilings, exposed beams, and expansive windows enhance natural light and ventilation, while materials such as wood, natural stone, rattan, and textured fabrics create warmth and a tropical ambiance. Bedrooms should function like hotel suites, featuring direct garden or pool access, spa-inspired bathrooms with rain showers and soaking tubs, and private terraces. Incorporating elements such as a shaded veranda, outdoor lounge, water features, and soft ambient lighting further elevates the relaxing atmosphere. A neutral color palette accented with earthy tones and lush greenery completes the resort feeling, making the home a daily retreat from urban life.
