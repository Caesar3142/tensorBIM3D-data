## Site Planning and Massing ##

On a 10 × 20 meter lot (200 m²), efficient zoning is essential. Consider a building footprint of around 6–8 meters wide to allow for side setbacks, light wells, or a narrow garden strip for ventilation. Place public spaces (living, dining, kitchen) at the front or center for easy access, and position private areas (bedrooms) toward the back or upper floor for privacy. A two-storey layout helps maximize usable space while maintaining open outdoor areas.

## Industrial Architectural Character ##

Modern industrial design emphasizes raw, honest materials and simple geometric forms. Use exposed concrete, steel frames, black aluminum windows, and brick or cement board cladding. Keep the façade clean with strong horizontal and vertical lines. Large rectangular openings, slim metal railings, and minimal ornamentation reinforce the industrial aesthetic while maintaining a modern feel.

## Structural Expression ##

Highlight structural elements as part of the design. Exposed steel beams, visible columns, and concrete slabs can become architectural features. Double-height spaces in the living area (if budget allows) create a warehouse-inspired atmosphere. Keep ceiling finishes simple, possibly exposing ductwork or using black-painted ceilings for a bold industrial look.

## Lighting and Ventilation ##

Maximize natural light with large windows, sliding glass doors, or even a small internal courtyard (2–4 m²) to bring light into the center of the house. Industrial-style clerestory windows or skylights can enhance daylight without sacrificing privacy. Ensure cross-ventilation by placing operable windows on opposite sides of rooms, especially important on compact urban lots.

## Interior Layout and Flow ##

Use an open-plan concept for the ground floor to enhance spaciousness. Combine living, dining, and kitchen areas into one continuous space, separated visually by furniture or level changes rather than walls. Use a straight-run or L-shaped steel staircase as a sculptural focal point. Maintain clear circulation paths of at least 900 mm for comfort in a compact layout.

## Material Palette and Finishes ##

Stick to a restrained palette: concrete gray, matte black steel, natural wood, and neutral tones. Polished concrete or epoxy floors work well for durability and style. Use reclaimed wood or plywood accents to soften the industrial feel. Avoid overly glossy finishes; matte textures better reflect industrial authenticity.

## Outdoor and Semi-Outdoor Spaces ##

Even on a compact 10 × 20 meter lot, incorporate a small backyard (minimum 2–3 meters deep) or a rooftop terrace. A covered front porch with steel pergola elements can enhance the façade. Integrating indoor and outdoor areas with large sliding doors strengthens spatial continuity and improves airflow.

## Services and Practical Considerations ##

Plan utility zones efficiently: align bathrooms vertically for easier plumbing, and position the kitchen near service areas. Ensure adequate drainage and waterproofing, especially if using exposed concrete finishes. Consider built-in storage to maintain the clean, uncluttered look typical of modern industrial homes.

## Modern Simplicity and Functionality ##

Keep the design functional and free of unnecessary partitions. Use built-in cabinetry and concealed storage to maintain visual clarity. The key to a successful modern industrial house on a 10 × 20 meter lot is balancing bold material expression with efficient spatial planning, ensuring the home feels open, bright, and comfortable despite its compact footprint.
