Masonry structures are construction systems made from individual units such as bricks, concrete blocks, or stones, bonded together with mortar. These structures primarily rely on their compressive strength to carry loads.

This topic involves the analysis and design of masonry walls, columns, and piers to resist gravity loads as well as lateral loads from wind and earthquakes. It considers material properties of masonry units and mortar, load distribution, cracking, and stability against buckling or overturning.

Masonry structure design follows established codes and construction practices to ensure safety, durability, and adequate performance, and is commonly used in residential buildings, low-rise structures, and architectural applications.
