This topic involves identifying waste characteristics and applying appropriate treatment methods such as physical separation, chemical treatment, biological processes, thermal treatment, and secure disposal. Treatment may also include recycling, resource recovery, and neutralization of harmful components.

Industrial waste treatment is essential for complying with environmental regulations, preventing pollution of air, water, and soil, and promoting sustainable and responsible industrial development.
