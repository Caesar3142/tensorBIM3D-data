Prestressed concrete is a type of concrete construction in which internal stresses are intentionally introduced to counteract the tensile stresses caused by external loads. This is achieved by tensioning high-strength steel tendons either before the concrete is cast (pre-tensioning) or after the concrete has hardened (post-tensioning).

By applying compressive forces to the concrete, prestressing improves strength, stiffness, and crack control, allowing structures to span longer distances with slimmer sections compared to conventional reinforced concrete. It also reduces deflection and enhances durability under service loads.

Prestressed concrete is commonly used in bridges, long-span floors, parking structures, and large buildings where efficiency, structural performance, and material savings are important.
