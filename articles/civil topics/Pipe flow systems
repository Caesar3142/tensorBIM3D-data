Pipe flow systems involve the movement of fluids through closed conduits under pressure, where the flow completely fills the pipe and there is no free surface. These systems are widely used to transport water, oil, gas, and other fluids in engineering applications.

This topic covers flow characteristics such as velocity, pressure, and discharge, as well as energy losses due to friction and fittings. Key concepts include laminar and turbulent flow, Reynolds number, head loss, and pump and pipe system interactions.

Pipe flow system analysis is essential for designing efficient and reliable pipelines, pumping systems, water supply networks, and industrial process piping.
