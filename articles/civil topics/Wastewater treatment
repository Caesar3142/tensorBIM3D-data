Wastewater treatment is a field of civil and environmental engineering that focuses on treating used water from households, industries, and commercial activities to remove pollutants before it is discharged into the environment or reused. Its main goal is to protect public health and prevent water pollution.

This topic involves physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes. Common stages include preliminary treatment to remove large debris, primary treatment to settle solids, secondary treatment to break down organic matter using microorganisms, and tertiary treatment for further purification and nutrient removal.

Wastewater treatment systems are essential for maintaining water quality in rivers, lakes, and coastal areas, supporting sustainable water management and environmental protection.
