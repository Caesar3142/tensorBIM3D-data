Traffic flow theory is a field of transportation engineering that studies how traffic moves on roads and highways. It focuses on understanding the relationships between traffic variables such as flow, speed, and density, and how these variables change under different roadway and traffic conditions.

This topic examines the behavior of individual drivers as well as traffic streams as a whole. It includes concepts such as uninterrupted and interrupted flow, capacity, level of service, shock waves, and congestion formation.

Traffic flow theory provides the foundation for designing and operating roads, intersections, and traffic control systems, helping engineers improve safety, efficiency, and overall performance of transportation networks.
