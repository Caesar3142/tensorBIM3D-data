Infrastructure asset management is a systematic approach to managing physical infrastructure assets throughout their entire life cycle. It focuses on maintaining, upgrading, and operating assets such as roads, bridges, water systems, and public facilities in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.

This topic involves collecting and analyzing data on asset condition, performance, risk, and costs to support informed decision-making. Activities include inspection, maintenance planning, rehabilitation, replacement strategies, and budgeting.

Infrastructure asset management helps organizations maximize the value of their assets, ensure reliable service delivery, reduce long-term costs, and improve resilience while meeting regulatory, safety, and community needs.
