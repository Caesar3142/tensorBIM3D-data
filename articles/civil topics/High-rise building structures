High-rise building structures focus on the structural systems used to support tall buildings and resist large vertical and lateral loads. As building height increases, wind and earthquake forces become dominant design considerations, requiring efficient and robust structural solutions.

This topic involves the analysis and design of systems such as moment-resisting frames, shear walls, braced frames, tube systems, and outrigger systems. Engineers must control strength, stiffness, stability, and building drift to ensure safety and occupant comfort.

High-rise structural design integrates advanced analysis methods, material selection, and construction techniques to achieve economical, safe, and durable tall buildings that perform well under gravity and lateral loading.
