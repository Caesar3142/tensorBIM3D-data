Climate change mitigation refers to actions and strategies aimed at reducing or preventing the emission of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. The goal is to limit the magnitude and rate of climate change by addressing its root causes.

This topic includes reducing emissions from energy production, transportation, industry, and agriculture through energy efficiency, renewable energy use, cleaner technologies, and changes in consumption patterns. It also involves enhancing natural carbon sinks such as forests and soils, as well as using technologies like carbon capture and storage.

Climate change mitigation is essential for minimizing long-term environmental, economic, and social impacts of climate change and supporting a more sustainable and resilient future.
