Cost estimation is a process in construction and engineering that involves predicting the total cost required to complete a project. It is used to support decision-making during planning, design, and construction by providing an understanding of financial requirements.

This topic includes estimating costs for materials, labor, equipment, transportation, overhead, and contingencies. Cost estimates may be prepared at different project stages, ranging from preliminary estimates for feasibility studies to detailed estimates for bidding and construction control.

Cost estimation helps ensure that projects are economically viable, budgets are realistic, and financial risks are managed effectively throughout the project lifecycle.
