Open channel flow is a topic in fluid mechanics that deals with the flow of liquids that have a free surface exposed to the atmosphere, such as rivers, canals, streams, and drainage channels. Unlike pipe flow, open channel flow is primarily driven by gravity.

This topic involves analyzing flow characteristics such as depth, velocity, discharge, and energy. Key concepts include uniform and non-uniform flow, critical flow, specific energy, hydraulic jump, and gradually varied flow.

Open channel flow is essential for the design and analysis of hydraulic structures such as canals, spillways, weirs, culverts, and flood control systems, ensuring safe and efficient water conveyance.
