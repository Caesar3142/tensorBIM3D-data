Earthquake or seismic design is a field of structural engineering that focuses on designing structures to withstand ground motions caused by earthquakes. The main objective is to protect human life by preventing collapse while allowing controlled damage to the structure.

This topic involves understanding how seismic forces are generated, how they are transferred through a structure, and how buildings respond dynamically to ground shaking. Key concepts include seismic loads, ductility, energy dissipation, natural period, damping, and structural irregularities.

Seismic design uses specialized analysis methods and design codes to ensure structures have sufficient strength, stiffness, and ductile behavior. It is widely applied in buildings, bridges, and infrastructure located in earthquake-prone regions.
