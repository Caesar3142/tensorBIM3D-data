Earth retaining structures are engineering systems designed to support and retain soil at different elevations. They are commonly used where changes in ground level are required, such as in excavations, road cuts, basements, and hillside developments.

This topic involves the analysis and design of structures such as retaining walls, sheet pile walls, anchored walls, and reinforced soil systems. Engineers consider earth pressures, groundwater effects, surcharge loads, and overall stability against sliding, overturning, and bearing failure.

Earth retaining structures are designed according to geotechnical and structural principles to ensure safety, durability, and adequate performance throughout their service life.
