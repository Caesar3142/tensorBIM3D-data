Risk management is a systematic process used in engineering and construction projects to identify, assess, and control potential risks that could affect project objectives. These risks may relate to cost, time, quality, safety, environmental impact, or contractual issues.

This topic involves recognizing possible risks, evaluating their likelihood and consequences, and developing strategies to avoid, reduce, transfer, or accept them. Common tools include risk registers, qualitative and quantitative risk analysis, and contingency planning.

Risk management helps improve decision-making, reduce uncertainty, and increase the likelihood of project success by proactively addressing potential problems before they occur.
