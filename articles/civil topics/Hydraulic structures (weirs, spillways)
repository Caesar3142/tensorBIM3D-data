Hydraulic structures such as weirs and spillways are engineering works designed to control, measure, and safely convey water in rivers, canals, dams, and reservoirs. They play a key role in regulating water levels and managing excess flow.

This topic involves understanding flow behavior over and through structures, including discharge capacity, energy dissipation, and downstream flow conditions. Weirs are commonly used to measure flow rate and control upstream water levels, while spillways are designed to safely release excess water from dams and reservoirs to prevent overtopping.

Hydraulic structure design considers factors such as hydraulics, structural stability, erosion protection, and safety under extreme flow conditions, ensuring reliable performance and long-term durability.
