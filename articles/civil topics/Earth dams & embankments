Earth dams and embankments are structures built primarily from compacted soil or rock to retain water, control flooding, or support transportation infrastructure. They rely on the strength and stability of earth materials rather than rigid structural elements.

This topic involves the design and analysis of embankment geometry, material selection, compaction methods, seepage control, and slope stability. Engineers must also consider settlement, erosion, and the effects of water pressure on the structure.

Earth dams and embankments are widely used in water resource projects, highways, and flood protection systems, and are designed to ensure long-term safety, stability, and performance under varying environmental conditions.
