Airport engineering is a branch of civil engineering that focuses on the planning, design, construction, and operation of airports and their related facilities. Its goal is to ensure safe, efficient, and reliable air transportation.

This topic covers the design of runways, taxiways, aprons, terminals, and drainage systems, as well as considerations for aircraft loading, pavement strength, and airfield lighting. Engineers must account for aircraft performance, safety regulations, weather conditions, and future traffic demand.

Airport engineering supports the growth of air travel and commerce by providing infrastructure that meets operational, safety, and environmental requirements.
