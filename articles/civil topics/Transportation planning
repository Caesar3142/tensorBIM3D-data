Transportation planning is a field of civil engineering that focuses on the long-term development of transportation systems to meet the mobility needs of people and goods. It aims to create efficient, safe, accessible, and sustainable transportation networks.

This topic involves analyzing travel demand, land use patterns, population growth, and economic activity to plan roads, public transit, railways, airports, and non-motorized transport facilities. Transportation planning also considers environmental impacts, energy use, and social equity.

Transportation planning supports informed decision-making by evaluating alternative solutions and policies, helping communities develop integrated transportation systems that support economic development and quality of life.
