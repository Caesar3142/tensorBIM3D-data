Soil consolidation and settlement refer to the process by which soil gradually decreases in volume under sustained loading, leading to downward movement of the ground surface. This behavior is most significant in fine-grained soils such as clays.

This topic involves understanding how excess pore water pressure generated by applied loads dissipates over time, causing soil particles to rearrange and compress. Key concepts include primary consolidation, secondary compression, and immediate settlement.

Analysis of soil consolidation and settlement is essential for predicting long-term ground movement, designing foundations, and preventing excessive or uneven settlement that could damage structures.
