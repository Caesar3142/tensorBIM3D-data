Highway engineering is a branch of civil engineering that focuses on the planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of roads and highways. Its main objective is to provide safe, efficient, and comfortable transportation for vehicles and pedestrians.

This topic covers route selection, geometric design of roads, pavement materials and design, traffic engineering, and drainage systems. Engineers consider factors such as traffic volume, speed, safety, environmental impact, and economic feasibility when developing highway projects.

Highway engineering plays a vital role in supporting economic growth and mobility by ensuring reliable transportation networks that connect cities, industries, and communities.
