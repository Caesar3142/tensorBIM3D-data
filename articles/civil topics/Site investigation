Site investigation is a geotechnical engineering process used to evaluate the ground conditions at a proposed construction site. Its purpose is to obtain reliable information about soil, rock, groundwater, and environmental conditions that may affect the design and construction of a project.

This topic includes desk studies, field investigations, and laboratory testing. Common activities involve borehole drilling, sampling, in situ tests, geophysical surveys, and groundwater measurements. The collected data are used to determine soil and rock properties, stratification, and potential geotechnical hazards.

Site investigation provides the essential foundation for safe and economical design of foundations, earthworks, retaining structures, and underground works by reducing uncertainty and construction risk.
