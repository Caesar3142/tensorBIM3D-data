Pavement design is a field of highway engineering that focuses on designing road surfaces to safely and efficiently carry traffic loads over their service life. It aims to provide adequate strength, durability, ride quality, and resistance to environmental effects.

This topic involves analyzing traffic loading, material properties, subgrade soil conditions, and climate factors. Pavement structures are typically classified as flexible pavements, rigid pavements, or composite pavements, each with different design approaches and performance characteristics.

Pavement design ensures that roads can withstand repeated vehicle loads with minimal deterioration while remaining economical to construct and maintain.
