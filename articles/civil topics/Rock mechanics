Rock mechanics is a branch of civil and geotechnical engineering that studies the behavior of rock materials when subjected to forces and environmental conditions. It focuses on understanding the strength, deformation, and failure of rock masses rather than just intact rock samples.

This topic covers properties such as rock strength, stiffness, fracture patterns, and in situ stresses, as well as the influence of joints, faults, and bedding planes. It also examines how rock responds to excavation, loading, and unloading processes.

Rock mechanics is essential for the safe design and construction of tunnels, underground caverns, slopes, foundations on rock, and mining operations, helping engineers assess stability and prevent rock-related failures.
