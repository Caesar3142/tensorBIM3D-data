Value engineering is a systematic approach used to improve the value of a project by optimizing the relationship between function, cost, and performance. It aims to achieve the required functions of a project at the lowest overall cost without compromising quality, safety, or reliability.

This topic involves analyzing project functions, identifying alternative materials, designs, or construction methods, and evaluating these alternatives based on cost, performance, and feasibility. Value engineering is typically applied during the planning and design stages but can also be used during construction.

Value engineering helps reduce unnecessary costs, improve efficiency, and enhance overall project outcomes by encouraging creative and cost-effective solutions.
