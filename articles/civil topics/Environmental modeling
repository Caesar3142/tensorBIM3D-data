Environmental modeling is the use of mathematical, computational, and simulation tools to represent and analyze environmental systems and processes. It helps engineers and scientists understand how natural and human-influenced systems behave under different conditions.

This topic involves modeling air quality, water quality, groundwater flow, climate processes, pollutant transport, and ecosystem responses. Models use data, assumptions, and physical laws to predict environmental impacts, assess risks, and evaluate management or mitigation strategies.

Environmental modeling supports decision-making in planning, design, and policy by allowing the assessment of future scenarios, comparison of alternatives, and improvement of environmental protection and sustainability efforts.
