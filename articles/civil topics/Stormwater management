Stormwater management is a field of civil and environmental engineering that focuses on controlling and managing runoff generated by rainfall and snowmelt in urban and developed areas. Its main purpose is to reduce flooding, erosion, and water pollution while protecting public safety and infrastructure.

This topic involves the analysis of rainfall, runoff quantity and quality, and the design of systems such as drains, pipes, detention and retention basins, swales, and infiltration facilities. Modern stormwater management also emphasizes sustainable approaches that promote infiltration, storage, and reuse of rainwater.

Stormwater management plays an important role in urban planning by reducing the impact of development on natural water cycles and helping maintain healthy waterways and ecosystems.
