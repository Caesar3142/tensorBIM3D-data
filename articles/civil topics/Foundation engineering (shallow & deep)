Foundation engineering is a branch of civil and geotechnical engineering that deals with the design and construction of foundations to safely transfer structural loads to the ground. The main objective is to ensure stability, limit settlement, and prevent bearing or structural failure.

Shallow foundations are used when competent soil is available near the ground surface. They include isolated footings, strip footings, and raft foundations, and are typically applied to low- to medium-rise structures where loads can be safely supported at shallow depths.

Deep foundations are required when surface soils are weak or when heavy loads must be transferred to deeper, stronger layers. Common types include piles, drilled shafts, and caissons. Foundation engineering involves analyzing soil and rock behavior, load capacity, settlement, and construction methods to achieve safe and economical foundation solutions.
