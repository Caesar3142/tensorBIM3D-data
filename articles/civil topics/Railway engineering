Railway engineering is a branch of civil and transportation engineering that focuses on the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of railway systems. It aims to provide safe, efficient, and reliable transportation for passengers and freight.

This topic covers railway alignment, track structure, ballast and subgrade design, stations, signaling systems, and level crossings. Engineers also consider train loads, speed, safety, comfort, and maintenance requirements in railway design.

Railway engineering plays an important role in sustainable transportation by supporting high-capacity, energy-efficient transport systems that reduce congestion and environmental impact.
