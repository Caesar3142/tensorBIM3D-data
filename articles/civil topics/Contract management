Contract management is a process in construction and engineering projects that involves planning, administering, and controlling contracts to ensure that all parties meet their obligations. It helps define responsibilities, manage risks, and maintain clear communication between clients, contractors, and consultants.

This topic includes preparing and reviewing contract documents, managing changes and variations, handling payments and claims, and resolving disputes. It also involves monitoring contract performance to ensure compliance with scope, cost, quality, and time requirements.

Effective contract management supports successful project delivery by minimizing conflicts, controlling costs, and ensuring that projects are completed according to agreed terms and conditions.
