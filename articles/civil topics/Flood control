Flood control is a field of civil engineering focused on reducing the risk and impact of flooding on people, property, and the environment. It involves managing excess water caused by heavy rainfall, river overflow, storm surges, or dam failures.

This topic includes the analysis of flood behavior and the design of measures such as levees, floodwalls, dams, retention basins, diversion channels, and drainage improvements. Non-structural approaches, such as floodplain zoning, early warning systems, and watershed management, are also important components.

Flood control aims to protect lives and infrastructure, minimize economic losses, and support sustainable land and water use in flood-prone areas.
