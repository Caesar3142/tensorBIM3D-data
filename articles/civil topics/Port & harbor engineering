Port and harbor engineering is a branch of civil and coastal engineering that focuses on the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of ports and harbors used for maritime transportation. Its main purpose is to provide safe and efficient facilities for ships, cargo handling, and passenger movement.

This topic covers the design of harbor layouts, berths, quays, breakwaters, jetties, and navigation channels. Engineers must consider waves, tides, currents, sedimentation, ship maneuvering, and environmental conditions in their designs.

Port and harbor engineering plays a critical role in supporting international trade, fisheries, and coastal development by ensuring reliable maritime access and long-term structural performance.
