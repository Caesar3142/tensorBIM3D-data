Timber structures are structural systems that use wood as the primary load-bearing material. Timber has been used in construction for centuries due to its availability, light weight, and good strength-to-weight ratio.

This topic focuses on the analysis and design of timber members such as beams, columns, trusses, and frames, considering loads from gravity, wind, and earthquakes. It addresses material behavior under tension, compression, bending, and shear, as well as effects of moisture, creep, and durability.

Timber structure design also includes the study of connections using nails, bolts, screws, or engineered connectors, and follows design standards to ensure safety, serviceability, and long-term performance in buildings, bridges, and other structures.
