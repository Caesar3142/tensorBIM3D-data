Reinforced concrete design is a field of civil engineering that focuses on designing concrete structures strengthened with steel reinforcement. Concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension, so steel bars or meshes are embedded in the concrete to carry tensile forces and improve overall structural performance.

This topic involves analyzing and designing structural elements such as beams, slabs, columns, footings, and shear walls to safely resist bending, shear, axial loads, and torsion. It considers material properties of concrete and steel, load combinations, cracking behavior, and long-term effects such as creep and shrinkage.

Reinforced concrete design follows established design codes and safety principles to ensure that structures are strong, durable, and serviceable throughout their lifespan while remaining economical and constructible.
