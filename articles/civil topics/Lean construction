Lean construction is a project management approach that focuses on maximizing value while minimizing waste in the construction process. It is based on lean manufacturing principles and aims to improve efficiency, collaboration, and overall project performance.

This topic involves identifying and eliminating non-value-adding activities such as delays, rework, excess inventory, and inefficient workflows. Lean construction emphasizes planning reliability, continuous improvement, and coordination among all project participants.

Lean construction helps deliver projects faster, at lower cost, and with higher quality by optimizing processes, improving communication, and creating a more predictable and productive construction environment.
