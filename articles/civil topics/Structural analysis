Structural analysis is a core topic in civil engineering that focuses on understanding how structures respond to loads and forces. It involves determining internal forces such as axial force, shear force, and bending moment, as well as stresses, strains, and deflections that occur when a structure is subjected to loads like self-weight, traffic, wind, earthquakes, or temperature changes.

The main goal of structural analysis is to ensure that a structure is safe, stable, and serviceable throughout its intended life. Engineers use it to check whether beams, columns, slabs, frames, trusses, and other structural elements can carry applied loads without excessive deformation or failure.

Structural analysis can be performed using simplified hand calculations for basic structures or advanced numerical methods such as the finite element method for complex systems. The results of structural analysis form the basis for structural design, helping engineers choose appropriate dimensions, materials, and reinforcement to meet safety codes and performance requirements.
