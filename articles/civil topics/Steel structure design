Steel structure design is a branch of structural engineering that focuses on the analysis and design of structures made primarily from steel members. Steel is valued for its high strength, ductility, and uniform material properties, making it suitable for a wide range of structural applications.

This topic involves designing elements such as beams, columns, trusses, and connections to safely resist loads from gravity, wind, earthquakes, and other actions. Key considerations include tension, compression, bending, shear, buckling, and fatigue, as well as the behavior of bolted and welded connections.

Steel structure design follows established design standards and codes to ensure safety, stability, and serviceability while optimizing material use and constructability in buildings, bridges, towers, and industrial structures.
