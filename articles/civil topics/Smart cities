Smart cities are urban areas that use digital technology and data to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and quality of city services and everyday life for residents. They integrate information and communication technologies with physical infrastructure and public services.

This topic includes the use of sensors, data analytics, and automated systems to manage transportation, energy, water, waste, public safety, and governance. Examples include intelligent traffic systems, smart grids, real-time environmental monitoring, and digital public services.

Smart cities aim to enhance urban living by reducing resource consumption, improving service delivery, increasing resilience, and enabling better decision-making through data-driven planning and management.
