Noise pollution refers to unwanted or excessive sound in the environment that can cause discomfort, health problems, and reduced quality of life. Common sources include road traffic, railways, aircraft, industrial activities, and construction work.

This topic involves measuring and analyzing noise levels, understanding how sound propagates, and assessing its impact on people and surrounding environments. Engineers develop mitigation measures such as noise barriers, sound insulation, land-use planning, and operational controls.

Noise pollution control aims to reduce harmful noise exposure, protect public health, and create more comfortable and livable urban and industrial environments.
