Slope stability is a topic in geotechnical engineering that focuses on analyzing the safety of natural and man-made slopes. It aims to assess the likelihood of slope failure and to ensure that slopes remain stable under various loading and environmental conditions.

This topic involves evaluating soil and rock properties, slope geometry, groundwater conditions, and external forces such as rainfall, earthquakes, or construction activities. Common analyses determine the factor of safety against sliding or collapse.

Slope stability analysis is essential for the design of embankments, cut slopes, earth dams, and open excavations, helping engineers prevent landslides and reduce risks to people and infrastructure.
