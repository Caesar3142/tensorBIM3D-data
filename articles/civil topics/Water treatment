Water treatment is a field of civil and environmental engineering that focuses on improving the quality of water to make it safe and suitable for human consumption, industrial use, or environmental discharge. It involves removing physical, chemical, and biological contaminants from raw water sources.

This topic covers treatment processes such as screening, coagulation and flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. Advanced treatment methods may include activated carbon adsorption, membrane filtration, and chemical treatment to address specific pollutants.

Water treatment is essential for protecting public health, meeting regulatory standards, and ensuring a reliable supply of clean water for communities and industries.
