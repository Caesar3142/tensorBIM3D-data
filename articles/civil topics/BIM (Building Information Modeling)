Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital approach to planning, designing, constructing, and managing buildings and infrastructure. It uses intelligent 3D models that contain detailed information about a project’s physical and functional characteristics.

This topic involves creating and using a shared digital model that integrates architectural, structural, and building services data. BIM supports activities such as design coordination, quantity takeoff, clash detection, construction planning, and facility management throughout the project lifecycle.

BIM improves collaboration, reduces errors, enhances decision-making, and increases efficiency by providing accurate, up-to-date information to all stakeholders involved in a construction project.
