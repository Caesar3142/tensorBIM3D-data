Hydrology is a branch of civil and environmental engineering that studies the movement, distribution, and storage of water on and below the Earth’s surface. It focuses on understanding how water cycles through the atmosphere, land, rivers, lakes, and groundwater systems.

This topic covers processes such as precipitation, evaporation, infiltration, runoff, and groundwater flow. Hydrology also involves analyzing rainfall–runoff relationships, streamflow, floods, droughts, and watershed behavior.

Hydrology is essential for the planning and design of water resources systems, including dams, drainage networks, flood control measures, irrigation systems, and sustainable water management projects.
