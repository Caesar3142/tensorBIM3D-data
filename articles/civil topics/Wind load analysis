Wind load analysis is a part of structural engineering that focuses on evaluating the forces and pressures exerted by wind on structures. Wind can create significant lateral loads, uplift, and vibrations, especially on tall buildings, bridges, towers, and long-span roofs.

This topic involves determining wind speed, exposure conditions, pressure distribution, and dynamic effects such as gusts and vortex shedding. The calculated wind loads are then applied to the structural system to assess internal forces, deflections, and overall stability.

Wind load analysis follows established design codes and standards to ensure that structures are safe, comfortable for occupants, and resistant to wind-induced damage and serviceability issues.
