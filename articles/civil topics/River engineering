River engineering is a branch of civil engineering that focuses on the study, management, and modification of rivers to achieve objectives such as flood control, navigation, bank protection, and environmental preservation. It deals with understanding river behavior and how flowing water interacts with sediment and riverbanks.

This topic covers river flow characteristics, sediment transport, erosion and deposition processes, and channel stability. Engineers design measures such as levees, revetments, groynes, river training works, and channel improvements to control flooding and prevent excessive erosion.

River engineering aims to balance technical requirements with environmental and social considerations, ensuring that rivers function safely and sustainably while supporting human activities and natural ecosystems.
