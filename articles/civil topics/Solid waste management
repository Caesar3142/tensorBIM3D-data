Its main objective is to protect public health and the environment while efficiently handling waste materials.

This topic covers waste generation and characterization, collection systems, recycling and reuse, composting, incineration, and sanitary landfilling. It also involves planning and managing waste facilities, reducing waste at the source, and recovering energy or materials from waste.

Solid waste management plays a key role in sustainable development by minimizing environmental impacts, conserving resources, and promoting cleaner and healthier communities.
