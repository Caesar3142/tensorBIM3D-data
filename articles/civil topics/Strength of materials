Strength of materials is a branch of engineering mechanics that studies how solid materials behave when subjected to forces and loads. It focuses on understanding stress, strain, deformation, and failure in structural and mechanical components such as bars, beams, shafts, and columns.

This topic examines how materials respond to tension, compression, shear, bending, and torsion, and how these loads affect strength and stiffness. Concepts such as elastic and plastic behavior, yield strength, ultimate strength, and factors of safety are central to strength of materials.

Strength of materials provides the foundation for designing components that are strong enough to carry loads without failing and stiff enough to limit excessive deformation, ensuring safety and reliability in engineering structures and machines.
