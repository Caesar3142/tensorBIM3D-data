Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) refer to the application of advanced technologies to improve the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of transportation systems. ITS integrates communication, information processing, and control technologies with transportation infrastructure and vehicles.

This topic covers systems such as traffic monitoring and management, adaptive traffic signals, electronic toll collection, real-time traveler information, vehicle detection, and incident management. It also includes vehicle-based technologies like navigation systems, driver assistance, and connected and autonomous vehicles.

Intelligent transportation systems help reduce congestion, improve road safety, optimize travel time, and support better decision-making for both transportation authorities and road users through real-time data and automation.
