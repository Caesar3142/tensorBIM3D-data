Urban infrastructure planning is the process of planning and coordinating the development of essential physical systems that support life and activities in cities. These systems include transportation networks, water supply, drainage, energy, waste management, and public facilities.

This topic involves assessing current and future needs based on population growth, land use, economic activity, and environmental constraints. Planners work to integrate different infrastructure systems so they function efficiently, safely, and sustainably while supporting urban development goals.

Urban infrastructure planning plays a key role in improving quality of life, promoting economic growth, and ensuring that cities are resilient, inclusive, and capable of meeting long-term social and environmental challenges.
