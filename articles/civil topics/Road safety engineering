Road safety engineering is a branch of civil and transportation engineering that focuses on reducing traffic accidents and minimizing their severity through the design and management of safer road systems. It aims to protect drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists.

This topic involves analyzing crash data, identifying hazardous locations, and implementing safety measures such as improved road geometry, signage, markings, lighting, barriers, and traffic calming devices. It also considers human factors, vehicle behavior, and roadway conditions.

Road safety engineering supports the development of safer transportation networks by applying engineering principles and systematic approaches to prevent accidents and reduce injuries and fatalities on roads.
