Bridge engineering is a specialized field of civil engineering focused on the planning, analysis, design, construction, and maintenance of bridges. It involves creating structures that safely carry vehicles, pedestrians, and utilities across obstacles such as rivers, valleys, and roads.

This topic covers different bridge types, including beam, arch, truss, cable-stayed, and suspension bridges. Engineers analyze loads such as self-weight, traffic, wind, temperature effects, and earthquakes to ensure structural safety, durability, and serviceability.

Bridge engineering also addresses construction methods, material selection, foundation design, and long-term maintenance, ensuring that bridges perform reliably throughout their design life.
