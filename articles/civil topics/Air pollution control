Air pollution control is a field of environmental engineering focused on reducing or eliminating the release of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Its main goal is to protect human health, ecosystems, and the environment from the adverse effects of air pollution.

This topic involves identifying sources of air pollutants such as industries, vehicles, and power plants, and applying control technologies to limit emissions. Common methods include filtration, absorption, adsorption, electrostatic precipitation, and catalytic conversion.

Air pollution control also includes monitoring air quality, enforcing environmental regulations, and developing strategies to reduce emissions, supporting cleaner air and sustainable development.
