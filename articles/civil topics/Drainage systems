Drainage systems are engineering systems designed to collect, convey, and dispose of excess water from land, buildings, and infrastructure. Their primary purpose is to prevent flooding, waterlogging, and damage caused by uncontrolled surface or subsurface water.

This topic covers surface drainage for removing rainwater runoff, subsurface drainage for controlling groundwater levels, and stormwater drainage networks including channels, pipes, culverts, and inlets. Engineers analyze rainfall, runoff, flow capacity, and site conditions to design effective drainage solutions.

Drainage systems are essential for urban development, transportation infrastructure, agriculture, and flood control, helping maintain safety, functionality, and environmental protection.
