Soil mechanics is a branch of civil engineering that studies the behavior of soil under various loading and environmental conditions. It focuses on understanding soil properties and how soil responds to forces applied by structures such as buildings, roads, embankments, and retaining walls.

This topic covers soil classification, permeability, compressibility, shear strength, and stress distribution within soil layers. It also examines how water in the soil affects strength and stability, including concepts such as consolidation, settlement, and pore water pressure.

Soil mechanics provides the theoretical foundation for geotechnical engineering and is essential for safe foundation design, slope stability analysis, and earth structure construction.
