Water supply engineering is a branch of civil engineering concerned with providing safe, adequate, and reliable water for domestic, industrial, and public use. It focuses on the planning, design, operation, and maintenance of systems that collect, treat, store, and distribute water to communities.

This topic covers water sources such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and groundwater, as well as water treatment processes including coagulation, filtration, and disinfection. It also involves the design of distribution networks, pumping stations, storage tanks, and service reservoirs.

Water supply engineering aims to ensure water quality meets health standards, supply is sufficient to meet demand, and systems operate efficiently and sustainably over the long term.
