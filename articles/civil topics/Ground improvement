Ground improvement is a geotechnical engineering practice used to enhance the physical and mechanical properties of soil to make it suitable for construction. It is applied when existing ground conditions are too weak, compressible, or unstable to safely support structures.

This topic includes techniques such as compaction, soil stabilization, grouting, preloading, vertical drains, and reinforcement with geosynthetics. These methods aim to increase strength, reduce settlement, improve stiffness, and control groundwater behavior.

Ground improvement helps reduce construction risks, allows the use of shallow foundations where deep foundations might otherwise be required, and provides more economical and reliable solutions for infrastructure and building projects.
