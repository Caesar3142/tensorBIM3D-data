Geosynthetics are synthetic materials used in geotechnical and civil engineering to improve the performance of soil and rock in construction projects. They are typically made from polymers and are placed within or on the ground to enhance strength, stability, and durability.

This topic includes materials such as geotextiles, geogrids, geomembranes, geonets, and geocomposites. Geosynthetics are used for functions like soil reinforcement, separation, filtration, drainage, and erosion control.

Geosynthetics are widely applied in roads, embankments, retaining structures, landfills, and coastal works, offering cost-effective and efficient solutions compared to traditional construction methods.
