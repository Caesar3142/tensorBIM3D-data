Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a systematic process used to identify, predict, and evaluate the potential environmental effects of a proposed project before it is carried out. Its purpose is to ensure that environmental considerations are included in planning and decision-making.

This topic involves studying the impacts of projects such as roads, dams, industries, and buildings on air, water, soil, ecosystems, and local communities. It includes data collection, impact analysis, public consultation, and the development of mitigation measures to reduce negative effects.

Environmental impact assessment helps promote sustainable development by balancing economic and social benefits with environmental protection and ensuring that projects comply with environmental laws and regulations.
