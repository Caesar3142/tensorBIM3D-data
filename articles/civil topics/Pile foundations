Pile foundations are a type of deep foundation used to transfer structural loads through weak or compressible surface soils to deeper, stronger soil or rock layers. They are commonly used for heavy structures, tall buildings, bridges, and waterfront structures.

This topic covers different types of piles, including driven piles, bored piles, and driven cast-in-place piles, made from materials such as concrete, steel, or timber. Piles can carry loads through end bearing, skin friction, or a combination of both.

Pile foundation design involves evaluating load capacity, settlement, group effects, and construction methods, as well as considering soil–pile interaction to ensure safety, stability, and long-term performance.
