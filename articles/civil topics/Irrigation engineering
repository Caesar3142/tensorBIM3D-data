Irrigation engineering is a branch of civil and agricultural engineering that focuses on the planning, design, and management of systems used to supply water to crops and agricultural land. Its main goal is to provide adequate water for plant growth while using water resources efficiently.

This topic covers methods such as surface irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, and drip irrigation, along with the design of canals, pipelines, pumps, and control structures. It also involves studying soil–water–plant relationships, water requirements of crops, and scheduling of irrigation.

Irrigation engineering plays an important role in increasing agricultural productivity, managing water resources, and supporting sustainable farming, especially in regions with limited or irregular rainfall.
