Dams and reservoirs are hydraulic structures built to store, control, and manage water for various purposes such as water supply, irrigation, hydropower generation, flood control, and recreation. A dam is the barrier that blocks or regulates water flow, while a reservoir is the stored body of water created behind it.

This topic involves the planning, analysis, design, construction, and operation of different types of dams, including earthfill, rockfill, gravity, arch, and buttress dams. Engineers must consider structural stability, seepage control, spillway design, sedimentation, and environmental impacts.

Dams and reservoirs play a critical role in water resources management, requiring careful design and monitoring to ensure safety, reliability, and long-term performance under varying hydraulic and geological conditions.
