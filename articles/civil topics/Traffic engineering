Traffic engineering is a branch of civil engineering that deals with the planning, design, operation, and management of traffic systems to ensure the safe and efficient movement of people and goods. It focuses on how vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists interact with road infrastructure.

This topic covers traffic flow theory, traffic volume studies, speed and delay analysis, intersection design, traffic signals, signs, road markings, and traffic safety measures. Engineers analyze driver behavior and roadway conditions to reduce congestion and accidents.

Traffic engineering plays an important role in urban and transportation planning by improving mobility, enhancing safety, and optimizing the performance of existing and future transportation networks.
