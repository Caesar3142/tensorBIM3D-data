Project planning and scheduling is a construction management process that organizes project activities to ensure work is completed efficiently, on time, and within budget. It focuses on defining what tasks need to be done, how they will be carried out, and when they should occur.

This topic involves breaking a project into activities, estimating durations and resources, and establishing logical relationships between tasks. Common tools include bar charts, network diagrams, and critical path analysis to identify key activities that control the project timeline.

Project planning and scheduling help coordinate labor, materials, and equipment, reduce delays, manage risks, and provide a clear framework for monitoring progress and making informed management decisions throughout the project lifecycle.
