Fluid mechanics is a branch of engineering science that studies the behavior of fluids, including liquids and gases, at rest and in motion. It explains how fluids respond to forces and how they interact with solid boundaries and with each other.

This topic covers fundamental concepts such as fluid properties, pressure, buoyancy, flow kinematics, and fluid dynamics. It includes the study of fluid statics, which deals with fluids at rest, and fluid dynamics, which focuses on flowing fluids and phenomena like velocity, flow rate, energy losses, and turbulence.

Fluid mechanics is essential for analyzing and designing systems such as pipelines, pumps, turbines, aircraft, ships, hydraulic structures, and environmental flows.
