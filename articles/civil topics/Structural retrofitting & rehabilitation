Structural retrofitting and rehabilitation focus on improving the performance, safety, and durability of existing structures. These processes are applied when buildings or infrastructure no longer meet current design standards, have suffered damage, or need to be adapted for new uses or increased loads.

This topic involves assessing the existing condition of a structure, identifying weaknesses, and designing strengthening measures. Common techniques include adding steel or concrete elements, jacketing columns, using fiber-reinforced polymers, and improving connections or foundations.

Structural retrofitting and rehabilitation aim to extend the service life of structures, enhance resistance to earthquakes or other hazards, and provide a cost-effective alternative to demolition and reconstruction.
