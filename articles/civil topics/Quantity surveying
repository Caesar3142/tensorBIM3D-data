Quantity surveying is a field of construction management that focuses on the measurement, estimation, and control of construction costs and quantities. It ensures that projects are completed within budget while meeting quality and contractual requirements.

This topic involves preparing bills of quantities, cost estimates, tender documents, and valuations of work done. Quantity surveyors manage costs throughout the project lifecycle, from initial feasibility and design stages to construction and final accounts.

Quantity surveying plays an important role in financial planning, contract administration, and cost control, helping achieve value for money and successful project delivery.
