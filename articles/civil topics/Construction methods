Construction methods refer to the techniques and processes used to build structures and infrastructure projects. They define how materials, labor, equipment, and technology are organized and applied during the construction phase to achieve safe, efficient, and economical project delivery.

This topic covers methods for constructing buildings, roads, bridges, dams, and other facilities, including excavation, concreting, steel erection, formwork, and prefabrication. It also involves selecting appropriate construction sequences, equipment, and temporary works based on project conditions and constraints.

Construction methods play a critical role in project success by influencing construction time, cost, quality, safety, and environmental impact, while ensuring that the final structure meets design and performance requirements.
