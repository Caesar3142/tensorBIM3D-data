## Design cheapest 2-bedroom house possible ##

To design the cheapest possible 2-bedroom house, focus on simplicity, compact form, and minimal structural complexity. Use a small rectangular footprint of around 36–45 m² with a straightforward layout: a combined living and dining area at the front, two compact bedrooms (about 2.5 × 3 m each) placed side by side, one shared bathroom centrally located for short plumbing runs, and a simple linear kitchen along one wall. Keep the roof form basic, such as a single-slope or simple gable roof, to reduce structural cost. Use locally available materials like concrete block walls, a light metal roof with insulation, and a smooth cement finish instead of expensive cladding. Limit large windows and decorative elements, but ensure cross-ventilation for comfort to reduce future energy costs. Avoid complex foundations and maintain a clean structural grid to minimize labor and material waste. By keeping the design compact, functional, and structurally straightforward, construction costs can be significantly reduced while still providing safe and comfortable living space.
