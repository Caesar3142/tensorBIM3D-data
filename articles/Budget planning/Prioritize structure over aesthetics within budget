## Prioritize structure over aesthetics within budget ##

To prioritize structure over aesthetics within a limited budget, allocate the majority of resources to structural integrity, foundation quality, and proper reinforcement while keeping finishes simple and functional. Ensure the foundation is well-designed according to soil conditions and use adequately reinforced concrete columns, beams, and slabs to guarantee long-term safety and durability. Invest in high-quality waterproofing, roofing systems, and proper structural connections, as failures in these areas are costly to repair. Simplify the architectural form to reduce structural complexity and avoid expensive cantilevers or decorative projections. Use clean, minimal finishes such as plastered walls, polished concrete floors, and standard window systems instead of premium cladding or ornamental elements. By focusing on strength, stability, and weather protection first, you ensure the house performs safely and reliably, while aesthetic upgrades can be added later when budget allows.
