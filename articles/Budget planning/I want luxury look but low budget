## I want luxury look but low budget ##

To achieve a luxury look on a low budget, focus on proportion, simplicity, and material consistency rather than expensive finishes. Use a clean, symmetrical façade with a balanced window layout to create a refined appearance without added cost. Choose a neutral color palette such as white, beige, or soft gray, paired with one contrasting accent like black window frames or warm wood tones. Incorporate simple architectural details such as recessed lighting, vertical wall grooves, or a framed entrance to add depth without complex construction. Inside, prioritize good lighting design with layered warm LED lights to create a premium ambiance. Use large-format but affordable tiles, laminate wood finishes, and minimalist cabinetry to mimic high-end aesthetics. Keep the design uncluttered and avoid mixing too many materials. By emphasizing clean lines, thoughtful lighting, and cohesive finishes, you can create an elegant and luxurious impression without exceeding your budget.
