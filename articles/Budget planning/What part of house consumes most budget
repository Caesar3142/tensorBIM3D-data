## What part of house consumes most budget ##

The parts of a house that typically consume the most budget are the **structure and foundation**, followed by the **roof system** and **mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) installations**. Structural components such as reinforced concrete foundations, columns, beams, and slabs often take the largest share because they require significant material and skilled labor. Roofing also represents a major cost due to structural framing, waterproofing, insulation, and finishing materials. MEP systems can be surprisingly expensive, especially plumbing and electrical wiring, because they involve concealed infrastructure, fixtures, and skilled installation. After these, interior finishes like flooring, doors, windows, and cabinetry contribute a substantial portion depending on material quality. In general, the structural frame and essential systems account for the largest investment, as they determine the safety, durability, and long-term performance of the house.
