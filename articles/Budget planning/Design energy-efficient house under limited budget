## Design energy-efficient house under limited budget ##

To design an energy-efficient house under a limited budget, focus first on passive strategies rather than expensive technology. Use a simple, compact rectangular building form to reduce construction cost and minimize heat gain or loss. Orient the house to take advantage of prevailing winds for cross-ventilation and position windows to capture natural daylight, reducing the need for mechanical cooling and artificial lighting. Incorporate deep roof overhangs to shade walls and openings, and use light-colored roofing to reflect heat. Invest in proper roof insulation, as it delivers high energy savings for relatively low cost. Limit large west-facing windows and use affordable shading solutions such as vertical fins or vegetation. Choose locally available, durable materials to reduce transportation costs and long-term maintenance. By prioritizing smart orientation, shading, ventilation, and insulation, you can achieve strong energy performance without relying on costly systems like full-scale solar installations or advanced HVAC equipment.
