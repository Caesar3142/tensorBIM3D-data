## Floor drain location ##

Floor drain location in a bathroom should be strategically planned to efficiently collect water from wet areas and prevent flooding. Drains are typically placed in the lowest point of the wet zone, such as near showers, bathtubs, or the center of the floor in open wet areas, to take advantage of natural floor slope. A slope of about 1–2 % toward the drain ensures water flows easily. For larger bathrooms or combined wet zones, multiple floor drains may be used to prevent water pooling. Positioning near plumbing lines simplifies installation and maintenance, while avoiding obstructions from fixtures and ensuring accessibility for cleaning helps maintain hygiene and safety.
