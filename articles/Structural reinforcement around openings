## Structural reinforcement around openings ##

Structural reinforcement around openings in a bathroom slab or walls ensures that cutouts for pipes, drains, or ventilation do not compromise the strength of the structure. Reinforcement, such as additional steel rebar, mesh, or beams, is placed around the perimeter of openings to distribute loads and prevent cracking, sagging, or failure. Properly sizing and positioning the reinforcement according to the opening dimensions and the slab’s load-bearing requirements is essential. This approach maintains structural integrity while allowing for plumbing, electrical, or ventilation penetrations, ensuring long-term durability and safety in the bathroom.
