To achieve good cross ventilation, the main principle is to allow air to enter from one side of the house and exit from the opposite side, creating continuous airflow across rooms. This requires openings on at least two opposite facades and minimizing internal barriers that block air movement.

A very effective layout is a rectangular house with windows on both the front and rear, and ideally also on one or both side walls. When you enter from the front, you step into the living area, which has a large front-facing window. Directly aligned behind the living and dining space, at the rear wall, install wide sliding doors or large windows facing the backyard. This front-to-back alignment allows wind to pass straight through the central living space.

The living room, dining area, and kitchen can be arranged in an open-plan format along the central spine of the house. Because there are no full-height partitions between them, air can flow freely across the entire common area. If possible, position the kitchen at the back corner with at least one window facing the side yard and another opening toward the rear. This creates diagonal airflow, which is even more effective than straight-line ventilation.

For the bedrooms, place them along the sides of the house, each with windows facing outward. The best arrangement is to ensure every bedroom has two openings on different walls if possible, such as one window to the side yard and a smaller high-level window or ventilation block toward the corridor or internal courtyard. If the lot width allows, maintain a side setback of at least one meter so windows can be installed along that side wall.

Another highly efficient strategy is to introduce a small internal courtyard or light well near the center of the house. This courtyard acts as a vertical ventilation shaft, pulling warm air upward while drawing cooler air from the front and rear openings. Bedrooms and bathrooms can have windows facing this courtyard to improve airflow without sacrificing privacy.

Bathrooms should be placed along exterior walls whenever possible, so they can have direct windows instead of relying only on mechanical exhaust fans. This helps remove humidity naturally and contributes to overall airflow.

Ceiling height also plays a role. Slightly higher ceilings in the living area allow hot air to rise, while clerestory windows near the top of the walls can help release trapped warm air. Louvered windows are especially useful because they allow airflow even during light rain.

In summary, a well-ventilated layout should have aligned front and rear openings, side windows for diagonal airflow, minimal internal partitions, and possibly a small courtyard. By ensuring that air can enter, move across, and exit the house without obstruction, you create a naturally cooler and healthier living environment.
