## Optimize natural airflow in narrow house ##

To optimize natural airflow in a narrow house, create a clear front-to-back ventilation path by placing operable windows or doors at both the front and rear façades to enable strong cross-ventilation. If side openings are limited due to adjacent buildings, incorporate a small internal courtyard, light well, or air shaft to introduce fresh air into the center of the layout. Use sliding or louvered doors instead of solid partitions to allow air to move freely between rooms, and avoid long enclosed corridors that trap heat. Position higher openings such as clerestory windows or ventilated roof spaces to release rising warm air through stack effect. Keeping the floor plan open and aligning doorways directly across from each other can significantly improve airflow efficiency, ensuring even a narrow footprint remains naturally cool and well ventilated.
