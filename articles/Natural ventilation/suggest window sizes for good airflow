To achieve good airflow, window size should be proportional to the floor area of the room and balanced between inlet and outlet openings. A common guideline for effective natural ventilation is that the total operable window area should be at least 15 to 25 percent of the room’s floor area. The key word is operable, since fixed glass does not contribute to airflow.

For example, if a living room is 20 m², the total openable window area should ideally be around 3 to 5 m². This does not have to be one single window. It can be divided into multiple windows placed on opposite or adjacent walls to create cross ventilation. If you have two opposite openings, each side can provide roughly half of that total area.

In bedrooms, which are usually around 9 to 12 m², an operable window area of about 1.5 to 2.5 m² is generally sufficient. A typical practical size could be 1.2 m wide by 1.2 m high, or 1.5 m by 1.0 m, depending on wall dimensions. The most important factor is that the window can open widely. Casement windows that open fully are more effective than sliding windows, since sliding windows typically allow only 50 percent of their area to open.

For outlet openings, the size should be equal to or slightly smaller than the inlet opening. If the outlet is too small, it restricts airflow. Balanced inlet and outlet sizes allow smoother air movement across the room.

Height placement also matters. Combining a larger low-level window with a smaller high-level window improves performance. The lower window allows cool air to enter, while the higher window releases warm air that rises. Even a smaller clerestory window near the ceiling can significantly enhance ventilation.

If cross ventilation is limited due to lot constraints, increasing window height and width on the available exterior wall can compensate somewhat. Tall vertical windows are especially effective because they capture airflow across different wind angles and promote vertical air movement.

In summary, aim for 15 to 25 percent operable window area relative to floor size, balance inlet and outlet openings, and prioritize window types that can open fully. Proper placement combined with adequate size will ensure strong and consistent natural airflow.
