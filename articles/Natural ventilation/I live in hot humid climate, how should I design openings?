## I live in hot humid climate, how should I design openings? ##

In a hot humid climate, openings should be designed to maximize cross-ventilation while minimizing direct heat gain and rain penetration. Place large operable windows on opposite walls to encourage continuous airflow, and prioritize tall, vertically proportioned openings to help release hot air. Use adjustable louvers or casement windows that can catch breezes effectively, and position some openings at higher levels to promote stack ventilation. Deep roof overhangs, canopies, and shading devices are essential to block intense sun and heavy rain while still allowing windows to remain open. Avoid large unshaded west-facing glass, as it increases heat gain in the afternoon. Incorporating perforated screens, timber slats, or secondary façades can provide privacy and reduce glare while maintaining airflow. The goal is to create shaded, breathable openings that keep air moving freely without overheating the interior.
