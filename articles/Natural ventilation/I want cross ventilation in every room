## I want cross ventilation in every room ##

To achieve cross ventilation in every room, ensure that each space has at least two operable openings positioned on opposite or adjacent walls so air can flow in from one side and exit from another. Arrange the floor plan so rooms are not boxed into the center without exterior walls; instead, align bedrooms and living spaces along the building perimeter or around a courtyard. Avoid long enclosed corridors that block airflow, and use transom vents, louvered doors, or high-level internal openings to allow air to pass through even when doors are closed. Position the house to capture prevailing winds, and stagger window placements to encourage pressure differences that drive airflow. Incorporating features such as light wells, side setbacks, or a central courtyard can further ensure that even interior-facing rooms receive consistent natural ventilation.
