## Position windows for stack ventilation effect ##

To achieve stack ventilation, position lower-level windows on the cooler, shaded side of the house to allow fresh air to enter, and place higher-level openings on the opposite or upper portion of the space to let warm air escape. The vertical distance between the low and high openings is crucial, as greater height differences strengthen the stack effect. High openings can include clerestory windows, operable skylights, roof vents, or upper-floor windows near the ceiling. In multi-story houses, stairwells or double-height spaces can act as natural chimneys, drawing hot air upward and out. Ensure internal doors or transom vents allow air to move freely between rooms so airflow is not blocked. By combining low intake openings with high exhaust vents and maintaining a clear vertical airflow path, the house can naturally cool itself as warm air rises and exits.
