## Exhaust fan placement ##

Exhaust fan placement in a bathroom is critical for effective removal of humid air and odors. Fans are typically installed in the ceiling, close to the main source of moisture such as over the shower or bathtub, to capture steam efficiently. For smaller bathrooms, a single centrally located fan may suffice, while larger bathrooms may require multiple fans or a combination with a window for cross-ventilation. The fan should be ducted directly to the exterior, not into an attic or crawl space, to prevent condensation buildup. Adequate fan capacity, measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM), and proper installation height ensure optimal airflow, reduce mold growth, and maintain a comfortable environment.
