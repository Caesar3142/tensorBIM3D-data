Yes, one staircase is more than enough for a two-storey house, and in fact it is the standard and most appropriate solution for almost all single-family homes. A second staircase is usually unnecessary unless the house is very large, has special safety requirements, or serves a non-residential function.

In typical daily living, one staircase provides clear, simple, and efficient vertical circulation between floors. It keeps the layout compact, reduces construction cost, and avoids wasting valuable floor area. In small to medium-sized houses, adding a second staircase often creates more problems than benefits by consuming space that could otherwise be used for bedrooms, storage, or living areas.

From a safety perspective, building codes in most countries allow a single staircase in a two-storey single-family house. Fire escape requirements are usually satisfied as long as bedrooms have proper windows for emergency egress and the stair is built to code in terms of width, headroom, handrails, and riser dimensions. Multiple staircases are generally required only in apartment buildings, offices, or public buildings with many occupants.

Layout efficiency strongly favors a single staircase. One well-placed stair, usually near the center of the house or close to the living area, minimizes walking distance and makes movement between floors feel natural. It also simplifies structural planning, plumbing alignment, and daylight strategies, especially if the stair is paired with a skylight or vertical void.

A single staircase is also easier to integrate into passive design strategies. It can act as a ventilation chimney if combined with high-level openings, helping hot air rise and escape. It can also bring daylight into the center of the house, reducing the need for artificial lighting in corridors and upper floors.

There are only a few situations where a second staircase might make sense, such as a very large house with separated wings, a house with a separate rental unit, or a design that intentionally separates service circulation from private areas. Even in these cases, the second stair is a choice, not a necessity.

In summary, one staircase is absolutely sufficient for a two-storey house and is the most efficient, economical, and comfortable solution. As long as it is well designed and correctly placed, it will fully support daily living, safety, and long-term flexibility without the need for additional stairs.
