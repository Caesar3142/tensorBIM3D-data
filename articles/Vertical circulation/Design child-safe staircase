## Design child-safe staircase ##

To design a child-safe staircase, ensure the steps have consistent riser heights and tread depths to prevent tripping, with risers ideally between 15–18 cm and treads at least 25–28 cm deep. Avoid open risers, or ensure gaps are small enough to prevent a child’s head or body from passing through. Install sturdy handrails on both sides at an appropriate height, and consider adding a secondary lower handrail for children. Use non-slip materials or anti-slip strips on each tread to reduce the risk of slipping. Balusters should be spaced closely (typically less than 10–12 cm apart) to prevent climbing or falling through. Provide strong, even lighting along the staircase to eliminate dark spots, and avoid sharp edges by slightly rounding stair nosings. Adding safety gates at the top and bottom of the stairs can provide extra protection for younger children.
