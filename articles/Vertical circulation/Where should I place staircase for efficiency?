## Where should I place staircase for efficiency? ##

For efficiency in a small or medium-sized house, the staircase should be placed near the center of the layout or along one side wall, rather than at the extreme front or back. A central position shortens walking distances between rooms and makes circulation more balanced between public and private zones. Placing it along a side wall can free up the middle space for flexible living areas and allows for easier structural support. Avoid putting the staircase directly facing the main entrance to maintain privacy and better visual flow. It is also efficient to locate the staircase near bathrooms or service areas so plumbing can be stacked vertically. Utilizing the space underneath for storage, a powder room, or cabinetry further maximizes functionality and ensures no square meter is wasted.
