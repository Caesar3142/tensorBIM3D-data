For a typical residential staircase, the recommended handrail height is between 900 and 1,000 mm, measured vertically from the nosing of the stair tread to the top of the handrail. This range is widely accepted by building codes and design standards because it provides a safe and comfortable grip for most adults during both ascent and descent.

In most single-family houses, a handrail height of about 900 mm is the most common and practical choice. It feels natural to hold, supports balance without forcing the arm too high, and works well for everyday use by adults and older children. This height also integrates well visually with residential interiors and does not feel overly institutional.

Some codes allow or recommend up to 1,000 mm, especially where stairs are steeper or where added safety is desired. This slightly higher handrail can feel more secure, particularly for taller users, but it should still remain within a comfortable reach range. Going much higher than this can make the handrail awkward to use and less effective for balance.

It is important to note that the measurement is taken from the stair nosing, not from the finished floor or the slope of the handrail. On sloped stairs, the handrail should run parallel to the pitch of the stairs and maintain a consistent height throughout the flight. Sudden changes in height reduce safety and should be avoided.

If the stair is open on one side and functions as a guardrail as well, the same height range usually applies for residential buildings. For landings or balconies, guardrail heights are often slightly higher, commonly around 1,000 to 1,100 mm, but along the stair flight itself, 900–1,000 mm remains the standard.

Handrail usability also depends on shape and clearance. The handrail should be easy to grip, usually circular or oval, and placed with enough clearance from the wall, typically around 40–50 mm, so fingers can wrap around it comfortably. A well-positioned handrail at the correct height is far more important than decorative detailing.

In summary, for a two-storey house, a handrail height of about 900 mm is ideal, with anything up to 1,000 mm still acceptable depending on local codes and user needs. Staying within this range ensures safety, comfort, and good everyday usability without overcomplicating the design.
