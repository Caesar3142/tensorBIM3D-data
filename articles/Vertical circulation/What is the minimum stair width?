For a typical two-storey single-family house, the minimum stair width is usually 800–900 mm, measured clear between walls or handrails. This range is widely accepted in residential building practice and most building codes around the world.

At the absolute minimum, 800 mm can work in small or compact houses. This width allows one person to move comfortably up and down and is acceptable where space is limited. However, it can feel tight when carrying furniture or when two people pass each other, so it should be used carefully and only when necessary.

A more comfortable and commonly recommended width is 900 mm. This width feels noticeably better in daily use, allows safer movement, and makes it easier to carry items such as laundry baskets, furniture, or groceries. For most family houses, 900 mm is considered the practical minimum rather than the bare legal minimum.

If space allows, stair widths of 1,000–1,100 mm provide excellent comfort and a more generous feeling, but this is not required for a normal two-storey house and is often avoided in small footprints because stairs consume space on every floor.

In addition to width, comfort and safety also depend on other stair dimensions: Riser height is typically 160–180 mm, Tread depth is typically 250–280 mm, Clear headroom should be at least 2.0–2.1 m, Handrails are usually required on at least one side

It is also important to measure stair width clear of handrails, not wall-to-wall. Handrails reduce usable width, so they must be accounted for early in design.

In summary, the minimum stair width for a two-storey house is about 800 mm**, but 900 mm is strongly recommended for comfort, safety, and long-term usability. Choosing the slightly wider option usually pays off in daily living without significantly increasing overall house size.
