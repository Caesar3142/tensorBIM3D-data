When deciding which rooms should face east or west, the key issue is how each space responds to sunlight and heat at different times of day. East and west sun is low-angle, harder to shade, and often responsible for the most uncomfortable heat gain, so these orientations should be assigned carefully based on how and when rooms are used.

East-facing rooms receive morning sunlight, which is generally softer and more pleasant. This makes east a good orientation for bedrooms, especially the master bedroom or children’s bedrooms. Morning sun helps warm the room gently, supports healthy sleep–wake cycles, and usually does not cause overheating later in the day. East-facing kitchens can also work well, particularly if breakfast and morning activity are important, as they benefit from daylight early in the day without excessive afternoon heat.

West-facing rooms receive strong afternoon sun, which is usually the hottest and most difficult to control. Because of this, west orientation should ideally be reserved for spaces that are used less frequently or can tolerate higher temperatures. Bathrooms, staircases, storage rooms, laundry areas, and corridors are good candidates for west-facing positions. These spaces can act as thermal buffers, absorbing heat before it reaches more sensitive living areas.

Living rooms and family rooms are generally better placed facing north or south rather than east or west, especially in warm or tropical climates. However, if a living room must face west due to site constraints, it should be well protected with deep shading, vertical fins, screens, or vegetation. Without shading, west-facing living spaces often overheat in the late afternoon and early evening, exactly when families want to relax.

Dining rooms can face east or west depending on lifestyle. An east-facing dining area works well for breakfast and daytime use, while a west-facing dining area may be acceptable if it is shaded and ventilated, especially if it is primarily used in the evening. In small houses where living and dining are combined, it becomes even more important to control west sun through shading rather than relying on room placement alone.

Kitchens are often best placed on the east or south side rather than the west. Cooking already generates heat, so adding intense afternoon sun can make the space uncomfortable. If the kitchen must face west, excellent ventilation and external shading are essential to prevent heat buildup.

In two-storey houses, orientation can also be layered vertically. For example, upstairs bedrooms can face east for morning light, while downstairs service spaces face west to block heat from entering the main living areas. This vertical zoning is a very effective strategy on small or constrained sites.

In summary, east-facing rooms are best for bedrooms, kitchens, and morning-use spaces, while west-facing rooms are better suited for bathrooms, stairs, storage, and service areas. Living spaces should avoid west orientation where possible, or be very well shaded if unavoidable. Assigning rooms based on sun behavior rather than symmetry greatly improves comfort and reduces heat problems in daily living.
