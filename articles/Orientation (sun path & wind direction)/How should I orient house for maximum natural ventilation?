## How should I orient house for maximum natural ventilation? ##

To maximize natural ventilation, orient the house to capture prevailing winds by placing major openings such as windows and doors on opposite sides of the building to create effective cross-ventilation. Ideally, align the longer sides of the house perpendicular to the dominant wind direction so air can flow straight through interior spaces. Use operable windows at both low and high levels to encourage stack ventilation, where warm air rises and exits through higher openings while cooler air enters below. Keep interior layouts open or use permeable partitions to avoid blocking airflow. Position courtyards, light wells, or side setbacks to channel breezes into the house, and avoid placing large solid walls directly facing the wind. Shading devices, overhangs, and vegetation can cool incoming air while protecting from excessive heat gain, ensuring the house remains comfortable without heavy reliance on mechanical cooling.
