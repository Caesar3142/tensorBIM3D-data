## I want house optimized for wind direction from south ##

To optimize your house for wind coming from the south, orient the building so its longer façade faces south and incorporate large operable openings such as casement or louvered windows on that side to capture incoming breezes effectively. Provide corresponding exit openings on the north side to create strong cross-ventilation, ensuring airflow can move straight through the interior without obstruction. Keep the internal layout open or aligned so that living spaces and bedrooms benefit directly from the wind path. Use shaded verandas or recessed windows on the south façade to allow windows to remain open during rain while reducing heat gain. Position courtyards, side setbacks, or wind corridors to funnel and accelerate airflow into the house. Avoid tall solid fences or dense barriers blocking the southern boundary, and use landscaping strategically to guide and cool the incoming wind before it enters the interior.
