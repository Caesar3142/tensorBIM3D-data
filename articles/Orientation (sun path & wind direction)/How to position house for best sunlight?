Positioning a house for the best sunlight depends on your climate and hemisphere, but the general goal is to maximize useful daylight while minimizing unwanted heat gain.

First, understand the sun path in your location. The sun rises in the east, moves across the sky, and sets in the west, but its angle changes throughout the year. In most regions, orienting the longer side of the house along the east–west axis allows the main façades to face north and south. This orientation makes sunlight easier to control compared to east and west exposures.

For many climates, north-facing façades (in the northern hemisphere) or south-facing façades (in the southern hemisphere) provide the most stable and even daylight throughout the day. These sides receive higher-angle sun that can be shaded effectively using roof overhangs. Place main living areas such as the living room and dining room on this side to enjoy bright, comfortable daylight.

Bedrooms can face east if you prefer gentle morning sunlight. Morning sun is usually cooler and less intense than afternoon sun. Avoid placing large windows or main living spaces on the west side because afternoon sun is stronger and can cause overheating.

Minimize west-facing openings or protect them with vertical shading devices, deep recesses, or landscaping. Service areas such as bathrooms, storage rooms, staircases, or garages can be positioned on the west side to act as thermal buffers.

Roof overhangs should be designed to block high summer sun while allowing lower winter sun to enter, if your climate has seasonal variation. This improves year-round comfort. In hot climates with minimal seasonal difference, shading should block direct sun most of the year.

Window placement also matters vertically. Higher windows allow light to penetrate deeper into rooms. Combining this with light-colored ceilings helps reflect daylight and distribute it evenly.

Consider surrounding buildings and trees. Ensure that neighboring structures do not block desirable sunlight, especially during cooler seasons. If possible, leave open space on the sun-facing side to maintain clear solar access.

In summary, position the house so the longer façades face north and south, place main living areas on the side with the most controllable and consistent sunlight, reduce west exposure, use shading devices appropriately, and account for seasonal sun angles and surrounding context. Proper orientation at the planning stage significantly improves natural lighting and overall comfort.
