## Shower enclosure vs curtain ##

A shower enclosure uses rigid panels, usually glass, to fully or partially enclose the shower area, preventing water from splashing onto the rest of the bathroom. It offers a more durable and watertight solution, enhances aesthetics, and can make the bathroom feel more modern and spacious. A shower curtain, in contrast, is a flexible fabric or plastic barrier that hangs from a rod and is easier and less expensive to install. Curtains allow more flexibility in access and style changes but provide less effective water containment and may require frequent cleaning to prevent mold and mildew. The choice depends on budget, space, maintenance preferences, and desired visual impact.
