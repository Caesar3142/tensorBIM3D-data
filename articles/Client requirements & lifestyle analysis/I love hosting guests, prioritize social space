## I love hosting guests, prioritize social space ##

To prioritize social space for hosting guests, design the house around a large, open central gathering area that seamlessly connects the living room, dining space, and kitchen. Keep this zone spacious and flexible, allowing easy movement and multiple seating arrangements. Incorporate a generous kitchen island or bar counter so guests can gather comfortably while food is being prepared. Large sliding doors that open to a patio, terrace, or garden can extend the entertaining area outdoors and improve flow during events. Minimize unnecessary partitions and keep circulation clear to avoid congestion. Provide a guest powder room near the social zone for convenience, and consider a secondary lounge or outdoor seating area for smaller conversations. By making the communal area the heart of the home and designing for openness, flexibility, and comfort, the house becomes naturally suited for hosting and entertaining.
