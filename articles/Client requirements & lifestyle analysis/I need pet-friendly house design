## I need pet-friendly house design ##

A pet-friendly house design should prioritize durability, safety, and easy maintenance while keeping the home comfortable for both pets and owners. Use scratch-resistant and water-resistant flooring such as matte-finish tiles, polished concrete, or high-quality vinyl instead of delicate wood. Choose washable, stain-resistant wall finishes and avoid toxic plants or materials. Create a designated pet zone near the entrance or laundry area for feeding, storage, and cleaning, and include a small built-in nook or sleeping area within cabinetry to keep spaces organized. Ensure good ventilation to manage odors, and consider installing a pet door that leads to a secure outdoor area or fenced garden. Avoid open stair risers and slippery surfaces to reduce injury risk. By integrating durable materials, smart zoning, and safe circulation, the house can remain stylish while accommodating pets comfortably.
