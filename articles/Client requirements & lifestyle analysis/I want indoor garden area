## I want indoor garden area ##

To create an indoor garden area, position it where it can receive natural light, such as beneath a skylight, beside large windows, or around a small internal courtyard. A central location works well so greenery becomes a visual focal point and enhances airflow. Use proper waterproofing and drainage to prevent moisture damage, and slightly lower the garden floor level or include a concealed drain system to manage watering. Choose indoor-friendly plants that thrive in filtered light and humidity. Incorporate natural materials such as stone, timber, or textured concrete to complement the greenery and create a calm atmosphere. Good ventilation is essential to prevent excess humidity, so consider operable windows or high-level vents nearby. By integrating light, drainage, and airflow thoughtfully, an indoor garden can become a refreshing and low-maintenance feature within the home.
