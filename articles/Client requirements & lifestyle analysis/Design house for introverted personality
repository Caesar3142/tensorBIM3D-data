## Design house for introverted personality ##

To design a house for an introverted personality, prioritize privacy, calmness, and controlled social interaction. Position the house to minimize direct exposure to the street, using a setback garden, screened façade, or courtyard to create a buffer from public view. Keep the layout inward-focused, with living spaces oriented toward a private garden or internal courtyard rather than outward-facing windows. Include cozy, smaller-scale rooms or reading nooks instead of overly large open spaces, allowing for quiet retreat. Use warm, muted color palettes and soft lighting to create a soothing atmosphere. Provide a dedicated personal space such as a study, hobby room, or meditation corner separated from high-traffic areas. Sound insulation between rooms enhances comfort and reduces overstimulation. The overall design should feel secure, intimate, and serene, offering refuge while still allowing controlled social spaces when needed.
