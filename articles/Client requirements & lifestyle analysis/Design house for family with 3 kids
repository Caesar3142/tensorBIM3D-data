## Design house for family with 3 kids ##

To design a house for a family with three kids, prioritize functional zoning, safety, and flexible shared spaces. The ground floor should include an open-plan living and dining area connected to the kitchen so parents can supervise children easily, along with a guest bathroom and possibly a small study or playroom. The upper floor can contain a master bedroom and three children’s bedrooms arranged around a shared bathroom, with an additional small family lounge to create a secondary activity space. Provide ample built-in storage in bedrooms and hallways to reduce clutter. Bedrooms for kids can be compact but well-lit, ideally around 2.7 × 3 meters each. Outdoor space such as a small garden or terrace is valuable for play and ventilation. Ensure safe stair design, rounded furniture edges, and durable, easy-to-clean finishes. The layout should balance communal interaction with private sleeping areas, allowing the house to adapt as children grow older.
