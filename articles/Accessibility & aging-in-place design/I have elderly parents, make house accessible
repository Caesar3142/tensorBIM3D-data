## I have elderly parents, make house accessible ##

To make a house accessible for elderly parents, prioritize step-free movement and minimize physical barriers throughout the layout. Keep essential spaces such as a bedroom and a full bathroom on the ground floor to avoid stair use. Ensure doorways are wide enough (at least 80–90 cm) for easy mobility, and maintain clear circulation paths without level changes or thresholds. Use non-slip flooring materials and avoid glossy finishes that may cause slipping. Install grab bars in bathrooms, provide a walk-in shower with a built-in seat instead of a bathtub, and ensure adequate lighting in all areas, especially hallways and stairs. Lever-style door handles are easier to operate than round knobs, and switches should be placed at accessible heights. If stairs are unavoidable, design them with gentle risers, sturdy handrails on both sides, and good lighting. By focusing on safety, comfort, and ease of movement, the house can support independence and long-term usability for elderly family members.
