Designing an elderly-friendly house focuses on safety, accessibility, comfort, and ease of movement. The goal is to minimize fall risk, reduce physical strain, and ensure long-term independence.

First, prioritize a single-storey layout whenever possible. Eliminating stairs removes one of the biggest safety risks. If a second storey is unavoidable, place the main bedroom, bathroom, and living areas on the ground floor so daily activities do not require climbing stairs.

Circulation spaces should be wide and unobstructed. Hallways should ideally be at least 1 to 1.2 meters wide to allow easy movement, especially if mobility aids such as walkers or wheelchairs are used. Doorways should be at least 80 to 90 centimeters wide. Avoid narrow corners and tight turns.

Flooring must be slip-resistant and level throughout the house. Avoid sudden changes in floor height or thresholds between rooms. Use non-slip tiles or matte-finish flooring materials. Rugs should be minimized or secured firmly to prevent tripping.

Bathroom design is critical. Use a walk-in shower with no step at the entrance. Install grab bars near the toilet and inside the shower area. A shower seat can improve comfort and safety. The toilet height can be slightly higher than standard for easier sitting and standing. Ensure good lighting and avoid glossy tiles that become slippery when wet.

The kitchen should have accessible countertop heights and clear working space. Frequently used items should be stored between waist and shoulder height to reduce bending or reaching overhead. Lever-type faucet handles are easier to use than round knobs.

Lighting should be bright and evenly distributed. Install switches at accessible heights and consider two-way switches in bedrooms and corridors so lights can be controlled from multiple locations. Motion-sensor lights in hallways and bathrooms improve nighttime safety.

Bedrooms should be located close to bathrooms to reduce walking distance at night. Provide enough space around the bed for easy movement. Wardrobes should have easy-to-reach handles and sliding doors instead of hinged doors that require clearance.

Handrails should be installed along any steps or ramps. If there is a small level difference at the entrance, use a gentle ramp with non-slip surface instead of steps. The entrance should be covered to protect from rain and reduce slipping risk.

Smart home features can improve convenience. Video doorbells, remote-controlled lighting, and emergency alert systems enhance safety and independence. However, controls should remain simple and intuitive.

Finally, design for comfort. Good natural ventilation, insulation, and temperature control are important because elderly individuals may be more sensitive to heat and cold.

In summary, an elderly-friendly house should be single-level if possible, barrier-free, well-lit, slip-resistant, and equipped with accessible bathrooms and kitchens. Clear circulation, proper handrails, and thoughtful detailing ensure safety and long-term comfort.
