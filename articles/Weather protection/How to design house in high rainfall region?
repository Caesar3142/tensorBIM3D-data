## How to design house in high rainfall region? ##

To design a house in a high rainfall region, prioritize effective water management, durable materials, and protected ventilation. Use a steeply pitched roof to quickly shed rainwater, and extend wide overhangs to shield walls and windows from heavy downpours. Install a well-designed gutter and downspout system that directs water away from the foundation, and ensure proper site grading so surface runoff flows outward from the building. Elevating the floor level slightly above ground or using a raised foundation can prevent flooding and moisture intrusion. Choose moisture-resistant materials such as treated timber, concrete, stone, or fiber cement, and avoid finishes that deteriorate easily in damp conditions. Provide covered verandas or recessed openings so windows can remain open for ventilation even during rain. Good cross-ventilation and adequate sunlight are essential to prevent mold and humidity buildup, ensuring the house remains dry, durable, and comfortable despite frequent rainfall.
