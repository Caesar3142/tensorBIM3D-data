## Hood duct routing ##

Hood duct routing involves planning the path for the ventilation duct from the range hood to the outside of the building. It should follow the shortest and straightest route possible to maximize airflow, minimize bends, and reduce noise. Proper duct diameter, smooth transitions, and sealing are essential for efficient extraction of smoke, grease, and odors.
