## Safe circulation width ##

Safe circulation width in a kitchen ensures comfortable and unobstructed movement between counters, islands, and appliances. For single-cook kitchens, a minimum of 36 inches (91 cm) is recommended, while 42–48 inches (107–122 cm) is ideal for multiple cooks or high-traffic areas. Adequate width improves workflow, reduces collisions, and enhances safety.
