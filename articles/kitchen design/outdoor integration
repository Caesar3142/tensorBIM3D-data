BBQ indoor/outdoor integration involves designing a cooking area that can be used seamlessly in both indoor and outdoor spaces. It requires proper ventilation, heat-resistant surfaces, and safe clearances from combustible materials. This setup allows social interaction, convenient food preparation, and flexible use of the BBQ in different weather conditions while maintaining safety and functionality.
