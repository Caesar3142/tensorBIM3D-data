## Duct routing constraints ##

Kitchen duct routing constraints involve planning the path of exhaust ducts to the exterior while minimizing bends, length, and obstructions. Ducts must avoid structural elements, electrical wiring, and plumbing, maintain proper slope for drainage, and use the correct diameter for airflow. Adhering to these constraints ensures efficient ventilation, reduces noise, and prevents grease buildup or airflow restrictions.
