## Microwave placement ##

Microwave placement should ensure safe and convenient access while maintaining kitchen workflow. Common locations include above the countertop, within wall cabinets, or built into a wall oven column. The bottom of the microwave should generally be 15–20 inches above the countertop, allowing comfortable reach and proper ventilation while keeping it away from heat sources.
