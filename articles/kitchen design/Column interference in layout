## Column interference in layout ##

Column interference in a kitchen layout occurs when structural columns obstruct counters, work zones, or appliance placement. Planning must accommodate these columns by adjusting cabinet sizes, using partial-height walls, incorporating columns into storage solutions, or creating islands and pathways around them. Proper design ensures workflow efficiency, safety, and aesthetic integration despite structural constraints.
