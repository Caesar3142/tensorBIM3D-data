## Floor drain planning ##

Floor drain planning involves placing drains in areas prone to water spillage, such as near sinks, dishwashers, or wet kitchens. Drains should be positioned to allow proper water flow using a slight slope, be easily accessible for cleaning, and connected to the main drainage system. Adequate planning prevents water accumulation, reduces slip hazards, and ensures efficient wastewater removal.
