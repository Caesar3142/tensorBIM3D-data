## Galley kitchen layout ##

A galley kitchen layout consists of two parallel counters with a walkway in between, often used in small or narrow spaces. This design maximizes efficiency by keeping all appliances and work areas within easy reach. It works best for one or two cooks, allowing a streamlined workflow while minimizing movement between the sink, stove, and refrigerator.
