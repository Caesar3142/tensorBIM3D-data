## Industrial kitchen ##

An industrial kitchen style draws inspiration from commercial or warehouse spaces, featuring exposed brick, metal surfaces, open shelving, and stainless steel appliances. It emphasizes durability, functionality, and a raw, utilitarian aesthetic, often with high ceilings, concrete or wood floors, and visible pipes or ductwork for a bold, modern look.
