## Single vs double sink ##

A single sink provides a large, uninterrupted basin, ideal for washing big pots and pans, while saving counter space. A double sink offers two separate basins, allowing simultaneous tasks such as washing dishes in one side and rinsing or prepping food in the other. The choice depends on kitchen size, workflow, and cooking habits.
