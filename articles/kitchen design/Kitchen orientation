## Kitchen orientation ##

Kitchen orientation considers the placement of the kitchen within a home to maximize natural light, ventilation, and workflow. Ideally, cooking and prep areas face east or south for morning sunlight, while windows or openings are positioned to facilitate cross ventilation. Proper orientation improves energy efficiency, comfort, and usability of the kitchen space.
