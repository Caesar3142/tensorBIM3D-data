## Ventilation code ##

Kitchen ventilation codes set minimum standards for airflow, exhaust capacity, and installation to ensure safety and indoor air quality. Codes typically specify range hood airflow rates (CFM), duct size and material, clearance from cooktops, and the use of makeup air. Compliance with these codes prevents smoke, grease buildup, and excess heat while maintaining proper ventilation and fire safety.
