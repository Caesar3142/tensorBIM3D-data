## Electrical load calculation ##

Kitchen electrical load calculation estimates the total power demand of all appliances, lighting, and outlets to ensure safe and efficient wiring. Each appliance’s wattage is summed, considering simultaneous usage, and appropriate circuit breakers and wiring sizes are selected. Proper load calculation prevents overloading, reduces fire risk, and ensures reliable operation of kitchen electrical systems.
