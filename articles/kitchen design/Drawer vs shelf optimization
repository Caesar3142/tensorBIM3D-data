## Drawer vs shelf optimization ##

Drawer optimization allows items to be accessed directly by pulling them out, making it easier to reach objects at the back and improving organization for smaller items or utensils. Shelf optimization provides open, stacked storage, ideal for larger items like pots and pans, but may require reaching or moving items to access those at the back. Balancing drawers and shelves can maximize both accessibility and storage capacity.
