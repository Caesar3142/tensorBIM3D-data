## kitchen Fire safety spacing ##

Fire safety spacing in a kitchen involves maintaining safe distances between heat sources and combustible materials. For example, cooktops should have at least 18–24 inches of clearance from overhead cabinets, and flammable items should be kept away from ovens, microwaves, and gas lines. Proper spacing helps prevent fires, allows safe movement, and ensures effective ventilation around appliances.
