## Phased installation ##

Kitchen phased installation involves completing the kitchen in stages rather than all at once. This approach can separate structural work, plumbing, electrical, cabinetry, countertops, and appliances into sequential steps. Phasing allows better budgeting, reduces disruption in the home, ensures quality control at each stage, and provides flexibility to adjust design or materials before final completion.
