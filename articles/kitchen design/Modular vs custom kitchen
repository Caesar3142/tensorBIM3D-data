## Modular vs custom kitchen ##

A modular kitchen uses prefabricated, standardized units that are easy to assemble, flexible, and often more affordable, allowing for quick installation and future adjustments. A custom kitchen is designed specifically for the space and user preferences, offering unique layouts, tailored storage solutions, and personalized materials, but usually involves higher cost and longer construction time.
