## Energy-efficient LED planning ##

Energy-efficient LED planning for a kitchen involves selecting LED fixtures for ambient, task, and accent lighting to reduce energy consumption and maintenance costs. Proper placement ensures even illumination on work surfaces, inside cabinets, and over islands, while considering color temperature for accurate food preparation and a comfortable atmosphere. LEDs also offer long lifespan, low heat emission, and flexibility in dimming and color options.
