## One-wall kitchen layout ##

A one-wall kitchen layout arranges all appliances, cabinets, and countertops along a single wall. This compact design is common in small apartments or open-plan spaces. While it limits counter space and storage, it keeps everything within easy reach and can be combined with a dining area or island to improve functionality and maintain an efficient workflow.
