## Fire safety spacing ##

Fire safety spacing in a kitchen ensures that flammable materials, appliances, and cabinets are positioned at safe distances to reduce fire risk. This includes keeping at least 18–24 inches between the cooktop and overhead cabinets, maintaining clearance around ovens and microwaves, and ensuring vents, hoods, and combustible surfaces are properly separated from heat sources.
