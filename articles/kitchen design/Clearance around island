## Clearance around island ##

Clearance around a kitchen island should allow safe and comfortable movement for cooking, cleaning, and dining. A minimum of 36 inches (91 cm) is recommended for single-cook kitchens, while 42–48 inches (107–122 cm) is ideal for multiple users or heavy traffic. Proper clearance ensures smooth workflow and prevents congestion.
