## Support for kitchen island ##

Support for a kitchen island ensures stability and load-bearing capacity for countertops, cabinets, and appliances. Depending on size and material, islands may use a combination of base cabinets, structural posts, brackets, or a reinforced frame. Proper support prevents sagging, allows safe use of heavy countertops like stone, and maintains overall durability and functionality.
