## Appliance height placement ##

Kitchen appliance height placement ensures convenience, safety, and ergonomic use. Wall ovens, microwaves, and dishwashers are typically installed at or slightly below countertop height for easy access. Refrigerators and tall units should allow clear visibility and reach, while small appliances on counters should remain within comfortable standing reach without obstructing workflow or sightlines.
