## Texture and contrast design ##

Texture and contrast design in the kitchen uses different materials, finishes, and patterns to create visual interest and depth. Combining smooth and rough surfaces, matte and glossy finishes, or light and dark colors can highlight features, define zones, and enhance the overall aesthetic while maintaining harmony and balance in the space.
