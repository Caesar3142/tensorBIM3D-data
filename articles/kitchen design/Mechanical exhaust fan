## Mechanical exhaust fan ##

A kitchen mechanical exhaust fan removes smoke, heat, moisture, and cooking odors from the space, improving air quality and comfort. Fans are usually installed above the cooktop or range, often integrated with a hood, and should be sized according to kitchen volume and cooking activity. Proper ducting and maintenance ensure effective ventilation and prevent grease buildup.
