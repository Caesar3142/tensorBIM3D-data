## Peninsula kitchen layout ##

A peninsula kitchen layout extends a counter from the main cabinetry into the kitchen, creating a partial enclosure. It provides extra workspace, storage, and seating while maintaining an efficient workflow. This layout is ideal for medium to large kitchens, offering many of the benefits of an island without requiring as much floor space.
