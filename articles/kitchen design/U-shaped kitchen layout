## U-shaped kitchen layout ##

A U-shaped kitchen layout features counters and cabinets along three walls, forming a “U” shape. This design offers plenty of storage and workspace, making it ideal for larger kitchens. It naturally supports the work triangle, allowing easy movement between the sink, stove, and refrigerator, while keeping everything within reach.
