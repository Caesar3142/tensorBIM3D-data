## Under-cabinet lighting ##

Under-cabinet lighting is installed beneath wall cabinets to illuminate countertops and work surfaces directly below. It provides focused task lighting for cooking and food preparation, reduces shadows, and can enhance the kitchen’s aesthetic with accent lighting. LED strips or puck lights are commonly used for energy-efficient, even illumination.
