## Clearance from wall cabinets ##

Clearance from wall cabinets refers to the space needed between appliances or countertops and overhead cabinets to ensure safety and usability. For example, cooktops typically require 18–24 inches of clearance below wall cabinets, while microwaves or vent hoods need sufficient space above for ventilation. Adequate clearance prevents heat damage, allows comfortable movement, and maintains workflow efficiency.
