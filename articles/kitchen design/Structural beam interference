## Structural beam interference ##

Structural beam interference in a kitchen occurs when ceiling or floor beams obstruct the placement of cabinets, appliances, or lighting. Design solutions include adjusting cabinet heights, creating soffits, routing ductwork around beams, or incorporating beams into shelving or island designs. Proper planning ensures functionality, maintains workflow, and preserves structural integrity while minimizing visual disruption.
