## Heat-resistant backsplash ##

A heat-resistant backsplash protects walls behind the cooktop or oven from heat, grease, and stains. Materials like stainless steel, tempered glass, ceramic tile, or stone are commonly used for durability and easy cleaning. Proper installation ensures safety, prevents wall damage, and maintains a clean, functional kitchen workspace.
