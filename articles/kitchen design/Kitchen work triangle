## Kitchen work triangle ##

The kitchen work triangle is a design concept that connects the three main work areas: the sink, stove, and refrigerator. The idea is to create an efficient layout where these points form a triangle, minimizing unnecessary movement. Ideally, each leg of the triangle should be between 4 and 9 feet, and the total perimeter should be 12 to 26 feet, allowing enough space for comfortable workflow while avoiding congestion.
