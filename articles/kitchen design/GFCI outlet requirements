## GFCI outlet requirements ##

Kitchen GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlet requirements ensure safety by protecting against electrical shock in areas near water. Outlets must be installed at countertops, near sinks, and within 6 feet of any water source. GFCI outlets must be used for all receptacles serving countertop surfaces, islands, peninsulas, and other areas where appliances may contact water, and they must be tested regularly to ensure proper function.
