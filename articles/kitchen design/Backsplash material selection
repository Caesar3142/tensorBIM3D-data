## Backsplash material selection ##

Backsplash material selection depends on durability, ease of cleaning, heat resistance, and aesthetics. Common options include ceramic or porcelain tiles, glass, stainless steel, natural stone, and engineered quartz. The choice should complement the kitchen style while withstanding splashes, stains, and heat from cooking areas.
