## Natural ventilation window ##

A kitchen natural ventilation window allows fresh air to enter and smoke, odors, or heat to escape, improving indoor air quality. Windows are ideally placed near the cooking area, such as above the sink or stove, and should be easy to open and close. Proper sizing and positioning enhance airflow, reduce reliance on mechanical ventilation, and contribute to a comfortable kitchen environment.
