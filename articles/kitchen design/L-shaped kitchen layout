## L-shaped kitchen layout ##

An L-shaped kitchen layout places counters and appliances along two adjacent walls, forming an "L" shape. This design is efficient for small to medium spaces, allowing for an open area that can accommodate a dining table or island. It supports the kitchen work triangle well, provides ample counter space, and keeps the workflow smooth between cooking, cleaning, and food storage areas.
