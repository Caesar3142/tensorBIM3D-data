## Open kitchen vs closed kitchen ##

An open kitchen is integrated with the living or dining area, creating a spacious, social environment and easier movement, but it may expose cooking odors and clutter. A closed kitchen is separated by walls or doors, offering more privacy, better odor control, and less noise, but it can feel more confined and limit interaction with other areas.
