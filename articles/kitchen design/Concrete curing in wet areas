## Concrete curing in wet areas ##

Concrete curing in wet kitchen areas involves maintaining adequate moisture and temperature to ensure proper strength and durability, especially under sinks or near water-prone zones. Techniques include covering with wet burlap, plastic sheets, or using curing compounds to prevent rapid drying. Proper curing reduces cracking, improves water resistance, and ensures a long-lasting, stable floor suitable for wet kitchen conditions.
