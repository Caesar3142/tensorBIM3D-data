## Gas vs induction stove ##

Gas stoves use an open flame to cook food, offering precise heat control and compatibility with all cookware, but they require proper ventilation and pose a fire risk. Induction stoves use electromagnetic fields to heat cookware directly, providing faster, energy-efficient, and safer cooking, though they require compatible magnetic-bottom pots and pans.
