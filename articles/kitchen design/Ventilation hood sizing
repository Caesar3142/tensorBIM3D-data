## Ventilation hood sizing ##

Ventilation hood sizing depends on the cooktop type, kitchen size, and cooking habits. A hood should be at least as wide as the cooktop, typically 30–36 inches for standard ranges, and installed 24–30 inches above a gas stove or 20–24 inches above an electric or induction cooktop. Proper airflow capacity ensures effective removal of smoke, odors, and grease.
