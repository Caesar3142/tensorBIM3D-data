## Grease trap system ##

A grease trap system captures fats, oils, and grease from kitchen wastewater before it enters the main drainage. It is installed in the plumbing line of sinks or dishwashers, allowing grease to float to the top while water flows out. Regular cleaning and proper sizing ensure the system prevents clogs, reduces maintenance, and complies with health and environmental regulations.
