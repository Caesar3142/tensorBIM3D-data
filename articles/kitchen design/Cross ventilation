## Cross ventilation ##

Kitchen cross ventilation uses openings, such as windows or vents on opposite walls, to allow fresh air to flow through the space, removing heat, smoke, and odors naturally. Proper placement and sizing of openings enhance airflow, improve indoor air quality, and reduce reliance on mechanical ventilation, creating a more comfortable and energy-efficient kitchen.
