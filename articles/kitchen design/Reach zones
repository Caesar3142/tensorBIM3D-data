## Reach zones ##

Kitchen reach zones refer to the areas within easy access from a standing position, typically divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary zones. Primary zones include frequently used items like utensils, spices, and cookware within arm’s reach. Secondary zones hold less-used items slightly farther away, while tertiary zones store rarely used or heavy items. Proper planning of reach zones improves efficiency, safety, and convenience in the kitchen.
