## Counter height standards ##

Kitchen counter height standards typically range from 34 to 36 inches (86–91 cm) from the floor, providing a comfortable working surface for most adults. Bar or island counters may be higher, around 40–42 inches (102–107 cm), to accommodate seating. Proper counter height ensures ergonomic posture and efficient workflow during cooking and food preparation.
