## Air change rate ##

Kitchen air change rate refers to the number of times the air within the kitchen is replaced per hour to maintain good indoor air quality. For residential kitchens, a recommended air change rate is typically 15–30 air changes per hour when cooking, achieved through mechanical exhaust fans, range hoods, and natural ventilation. Adequate air changes help remove heat, smoke, moisture, and odors efficiently.
