## Sink placement ##

Sink placement should balance convenience, workflow, and plumbing requirements. It is typically located within the kitchen work triangle, with enough counter space on either side for food prep and drying. Proper placement avoids obstructing movement, provides easy access to water and drainage, and keeps the area functional for cooking and cleaning tasks.
