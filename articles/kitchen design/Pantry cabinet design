## Pantry cabinet design ##

A pantry cabinet is a tall storage unit designed to store food, kitchen supplies, and small appliances. It can feature adjustable shelves, pull-out drawers, or baskets for easy access and organization. Pantry cabinets are usually 84 to 96 inches (213–244 cm) high, 18 to 24 inches (46–61 cm) deep, and can be placed as standalone units or integrated with other kitchen cabinetry.
