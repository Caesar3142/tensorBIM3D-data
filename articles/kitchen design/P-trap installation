## P-trap installation ##

P-trap installation involves connecting a curved pipe under sinks or appliances to prevent sewer gases from entering the kitchen. The P-trap must be aligned properly with the drain and vent system, maintaining the correct slope for drainage. It should be easily accessible for cleaning and comply with plumbing codes to ensure effective sealing and water flow.
