## Drainage slope ##

Drainage slope refers to the slight angle applied to pipes to allow wastewater to flow naturally by gravity toward the main drain. A typical slope is about 1/4 inch per foot (2%) for horizontal drains, ensuring proper flow and preventing blockages or standing water in sinks, dishwashers, and other plumbing fixtures.
