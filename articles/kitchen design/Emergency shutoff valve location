## Emergency shutoff valve location ##

A kitchen emergency shutoff valve should be installed in an easily accessible location near the main water or gas supply to the kitchen. It allows quick disconnection in case of leaks, fire, or other emergencies, minimizing damage and enhancing safety. The valve should be clearly marked and unobstructed for immediate access.
