## Load from stone countertop ##

The load from a stone countertop depends on its material, thickness, and size. Granite or quartz countertops typically weigh 18–20 pounds per square foot for a 3 cm (1¼ inch) thickness. Proper support with cabinets, brackets, or reinforced framing is necessary to prevent sagging, ensure safety, and maintain structural integrity in the kitchen layout.
