## Oven installation height ##

Oven installation height should allow easy access without bending or reaching excessively. Wall ovens are typically installed with the center of the oven about 36 to 48 inches from the floor, depending on user height, so that controls and the interior are comfortably reachable. Proper height improves safety and convenience while cooking.
