Base cabinets in a kitchen are typically 34.5 inches (88 cm) high without the countertop and 24 inches (61 cm) deep. With the countertop, the total height becomes about 36 inches (91 cm). Standard widths range from 12 to 48 inches (30–122 cm) in 3-inch increments, allowing flexibility for sinks, appliances, and storage needs.
