Kitchen odor control involves strategies to minimize cooking smells and maintain air quality. This includes using range hoods with proper ventilation, mechanical exhaust fans, cross ventilation through windows, and air purifiers or charcoal filters. Regular cleaning of drains, garbage, and appliances also helps prevent lingering odors and ensures a fresh, comfortable kitchen environment.
