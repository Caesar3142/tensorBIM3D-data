## Floor finish level difference ##

Kitchen floor finish level difference refers to variations in height between the kitchen floor and adjoining spaces or different flooring materials. Small differences, usually 1/4 inch (6 mm) or less, can be managed with thresholds or transitions to prevent tripping hazards. Proper leveling ensures smooth movement, accommodates cabinetry and appliances, and maintains safety and aesthetic continuity.
