## Dishwasher plumbing ##

Dishwasher plumbing includes connections for water supply, drainage, and sometimes electrical power. The water supply line typically connects to hot water under the sink, while the drain is routed to the sink drain or garbage disposal with a high loop or air gap to prevent backflow. Proper installation ensures efficient operation, prevents leaks, and meets plumbing codes.
