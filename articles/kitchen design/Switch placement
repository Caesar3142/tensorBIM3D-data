## Switch placement ##

Kitchen switch placement should provide easy and safe access to lighting and appliances. Wall switches are typically located near entrances, at a standard height of about 48 inches from the floor, and away from water sources. Proper placement ensures convenient control of ambient, task, and accent lighting while minimizing the risk of electrical hazards.
