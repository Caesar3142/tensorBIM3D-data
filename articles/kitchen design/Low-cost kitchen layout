## Low-cost kitchen layout ##

A low-cost kitchen layout focuses on efficiency and functionality while minimizing expenses. It typically uses standard cabinet sizes, affordable materials like laminate or MDF, and simple finishes. Compact designs such as one-wall or L-shaped layouts reduce the need for extensive cabinetry and plumbing, while careful planning ensures an efficient workflow without high-end appliances or custom features.
