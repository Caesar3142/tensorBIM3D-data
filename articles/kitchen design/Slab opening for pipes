## Slab opening for pipes ##

Slab openings for kitchen pipes are pre-planned holes in the floor or ceiling slab that allow water supply, drainage, and gas lines to pass through. These openings must be accurately sized and positioned to align with sinks, appliances, and fixtures while maintaining structural integrity. Proper planning prevents leaks, facilitates installation, and ensures compliance with plumbing and building codes.
