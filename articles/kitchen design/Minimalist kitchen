## Minimalist kitchen ##

A minimalist kitchen focuses on simplicity, functionality, and uncluttered spaces. It features clean lines, hidden storage, neutral colors, and minimal decorative elements. Appliances and fixtures are often integrated, and countertops are kept clear to emphasize openness, efficiency, and a calm, organized environment.
