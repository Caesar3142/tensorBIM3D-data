## Cooktop placement ##

Cooktop placement should ensure safety, accessibility, and efficient workflow. It is ideally positioned within the work triangle, with sufficient counter space on both sides for preparation and landing areas. Proper clearance from walls, cabinets, and overhead appliances is needed to prevent fire hazards and allow comfortable movement while cooking.
