## Kitchen zoning ##

Kitchen zoning divides the kitchen into specific areas based on activities, such as cooking, cleaning, storage, and preparation. By grouping related tasks and placing appliances, counters, and storage accordingly, zoning improves workflow efficiency, reduces movement, and makes the kitchen safer and easier to use.
