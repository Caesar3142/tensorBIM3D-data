## Minimum kitchen size standards ##

Minimum kitchen size standards generally depend on building codes and practical usability. For a functional layout, a small kitchen should typically have at least 70–80 square feet, with a minimum clearance of 36 inches for walking paths and workspace between counters. In residential designs, kitchens often require enough space for basic appliances, cabinets, and movement, ensuring efficiency and safety while cooking.
