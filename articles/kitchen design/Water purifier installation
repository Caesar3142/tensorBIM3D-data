## Water purifier installation ##

Water purifier installation involves connecting the unit to the main cold water supply, usually under the sink or on the countertop. Proper placement ensures easy access for filter changes and maintenance. The installation should include a dedicated faucet or tap, secure tubing, and leak-free connections while maintaining sufficient clearance and accessibility.
