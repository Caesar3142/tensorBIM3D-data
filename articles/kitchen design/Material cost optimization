## Material cost optimization ##

Kitchen material cost optimization involves selecting durable, functional, and aesthetically suitable materials while minimizing expenses. Strategies include using standard-sized cabinets and countertops, opting for laminate or engineered stone instead of natural stone, combining high-end finishes in visible areas with affordable materials elsewhere, and planning efficient layouts to reduce waste. Careful material selection balances quality, longevity, and budget.
