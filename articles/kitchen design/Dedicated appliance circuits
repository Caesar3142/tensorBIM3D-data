## Dedicated appliance circuits ##

Dedicated appliance circuits provide individual electrical lines for high-power kitchen appliances like ovens, microwaves, dishwashers, and refrigerators. Each circuit is protected by its own breaker, ensuring the appliance receives sufficient power, reducing the risk of overloading, and improving safety and reliability in the kitchen electrical system.
