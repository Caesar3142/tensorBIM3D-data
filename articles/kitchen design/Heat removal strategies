## Heat removal strategies ##

Kitchen heat removal strategies focus on keeping the space comfortable and safe by reducing excess heat from cooking. Common methods include using range hoods or mechanical exhaust fans, incorporating natural or cross ventilation through windows and vents, selecting heat-resistant materials, and placing appliances to minimize concentrated heat zones. Proper planning helps maintain airflow, prevent overheating, and improve energy efficiency.
