## Ceiling height considerations ##

Kitchen ceiling height considerations affect ventilation, lighting, and the overall sense of space. Standard residential ceilings are typically 8–9 feet, providing enough room for cabinets, hoods, and lighting fixtures. Higher ceilings allow for larger cabinets, taller appliances, better airflow, and the possibility of decorative lighting, while lower ceilings may require careful planning to maintain comfortable movement and sufficient ventilation.
