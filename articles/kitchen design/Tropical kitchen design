## Tropical kitchen design ##

Tropical kitchen design incorporates natural materials, bright colors, and plenty of ventilation to create a fresh, airy atmosphere. It often uses wood, bamboo, or rattan elements, large windows or openings for cross ventilation, and light-colored finishes to keep the space cool. The style emphasizes indoor-outdoor connections and a relaxed, natural aesthetic.
