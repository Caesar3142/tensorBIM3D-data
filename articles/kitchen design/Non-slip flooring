## Non-slip flooring ##

Non-slip kitchen flooring uses textured or treated surfaces to reduce the risk of slipping, especially in areas prone to spills or moisture. Materials such as textured tiles, vinyl, rubber, or treated wood enhance traction while remaining durable and easy to clean. Proper non-slip flooring improves safety for all kitchen users.
