## Electrical outlet spacing ##

Kitchen electrical outlet spacing should comply with safety codes and provide convenient access for appliances. Outlets are typically placed every 4 feet along countertops, with additional outlets near sinks, islands, and work areas. Proper spacing prevents overloading, allows flexibility for small appliances, and maintains a safe, functional kitchen layout.
