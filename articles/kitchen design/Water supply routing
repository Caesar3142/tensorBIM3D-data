## Water supply routing ##

Water supply routing involves planning the path of pipes from the main supply to sinks, dishwashers, and appliances. Pipes should be positioned to minimize bends and length, reduce pressure loss, and avoid heat sources or electrical wiring. Proper routing ensures reliable water flow, easy maintenance, and prevents leaks or damage over time.
