## Ambient lighting ##

Kitchen ambient lighting provides overall illumination for the space, ensuring safety and visibility while performing tasks. It is usually achieved with ceiling-mounted fixtures, recessed lights, or LED panels that evenly light the room. Proper ambient lighting creates a comfortable environment, complements task and accent lighting, and enhances the overall kitchen design.
