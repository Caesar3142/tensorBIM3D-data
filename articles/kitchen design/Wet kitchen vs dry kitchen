## Wet kitchen vs dry kitchen ##

A wet kitchen is designed for heavy cooking, with water supply and drainage for tasks like washing dishes and preparing food, often using materials that resist moisture and stains. A dry kitchen is meant for light cooking, serving, or storage, typically featuring counters for appliances and minimal water use. Wet kitchens are common in homes with heavy cooking needs, while dry kitchens are used for quick meal prep and entertaining.
