## Distance between counters ##

The distance between counters in a kitchen should allow comfortable movement and workspace. For a single cook, a minimum of 36 inches is recommended, while 42 to 48 inches is ideal for kitchens used by multiple people. This spacing ensures safe and efficient workflow between appliances, sinks, and preparation areas.
