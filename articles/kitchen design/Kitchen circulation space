## Kitchen circulation space ##

Kitchen circulation space refers to the area that allows movement between work zones, appliances, and counters. Adequate circulation ensures that people can move freely without obstruction, typically requiring at least 36 inches for a single cook and 42–48 inches for multiple cooks. Proper circulation improves workflow, safety, and comfort while using the kitchen.
