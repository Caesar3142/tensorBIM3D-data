## Tall unit cabinet planning ##

Tall unit cabinet planning involves designing floor-to-ceiling cabinets to maximize vertical storage for pantry items, appliances, or cleaning supplies. These cabinets should include adjustable shelves, pull-out trays, or built-in organizers for accessibility, and be positioned to maintain an efficient kitchen workflow without obstructing movement or visibility.
