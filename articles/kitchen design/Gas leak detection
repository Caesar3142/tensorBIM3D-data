Kitchen gas leak detection involves installing sensors or detectors near gas appliances to identify leaks early. These devices trigger alarms or connect to smart systems to alert occupants, helping prevent fires, explosions, and health hazards. Proper placement, regular testing, and maintenance are essential for effective safety in gas-equipped kitchens.
