## Waterproofing under sink ##

Waterproofing under the sink involves applying moisture-resistant materials to the cabinet base and surrounding walls to prevent damage from leaks or spills. This can include using waterproof liners, sealants, or treated panels. Proper waterproofing protects cabinetry, flooring, and stored items while extending the lifespan of the kitchen structure.
