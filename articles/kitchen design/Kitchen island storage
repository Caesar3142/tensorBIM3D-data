## Kitchen island storage ##

Kitchen island storage provides additional space for cabinets, drawers, or open shelving within a freestanding island. It can hold cookware, utensils, pantry items, or small appliances, helping to declutter countertops and improve workflow. Islands may also include specialized storage like pull-out bins, wine racks, or seating areas with hidden compartments.
