## Powder room planning ##

Powder room planning focuses on creating a compact, functional, and aesthetically pleasing half-bathroom, usually containing only a toilet and a sink. Because space is limited, the layout emphasizes efficiency, with wall-mounted or pedestal sinks to save floor space and provide easier cleaning. Minimum dimensions are typically around 3 feet by 6 feet (0.9 × 1.8 meters), with at least 15 inches (38 cm) from the center of the toilet to walls or obstructions and 24 inches (61 cm) of clearance in front. Placement near common areas like living or dining rooms ensures convenience for guests, while careful attention to ventilation, lighting, and storage solutions, such as shelves or recessed cabinets, enhances usability and comfort despite the small footprint.
