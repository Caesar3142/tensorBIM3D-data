## Marble vs ceramic tile ##

Marble and ceramic tiles are popular choices for bathroom finishes, each with different characteristics. Marble is a natural stone that offers a luxurious, elegant appearance with unique veining and patterns. It is durable but porous, requiring sealing to resist water, stains, and etching, and it can be more expensive and heavier to install. Ceramic tiles are manufactured from clay and other materials, offering a wide range of colors, patterns, and finishes. They are generally more affordable, water-resistant, easier to clean, and lower maintenance than marble, making them practical for high-moisture areas. The choice depends on budget, desired aesthetics, maintenance willingness, and the bathroom’s overall design style.
