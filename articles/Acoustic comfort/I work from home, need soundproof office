## I work from home, need soundproof office ##

To create a soundproof home office, position it away from high-traffic areas such as the living room or kitchen, ideally at the front or rear corner of the house for separation. Use solid-core doors instead of hollow ones, and install proper door seals to prevent sound leakage. Add acoustic insulation within the walls and ceiling, such as mineral wool or dense fiberglass, to reduce noise transmission. Double-glazed windows help block exterior noise, and heavy curtains can provide additional sound dampening. Avoid shared walls with bathrooms or noisy service areas when possible. Soft finishes like rugs, upholstered furniture, and acoustic wall panels help absorb internal echo and improve sound quality for video calls. By combining strategic placement, insulated partitions, and sound-absorbing materials, you can create a quiet, professional workspace within your home.
