## Stack ventilation ##

Stack ventilation in a bathroom is a passive ventilation strategy that relies on the natural rise of warm, humid air to create airflow and remove moisture and odors. Warm air from the bathroom rises and exits through vertical vents or roof openings, while cooler, fresh air enters through lower openings such as windows or vents. This creates a continuous air movement without the need for mechanical fans. Proper design of stack ventilation requires correctly sized vertical shafts, unobstructed airflow paths, and placement of inlet and outlet openings to maximize efficiency. Stack ventilation helps reduce humidity, control condensation, and improve indoor air quality in bathrooms, especially in spaces where mechanical systems are limited.
