Aluminum composite panel (ACP) is a lightweight, prefabricated cladding material consisting of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a non-aluminum core, typically made of polyethylene or a fire-retardant mineral-filled material, designed to combine strength, flexibility, and aesthetic versatility. Widely used for building façades, interior wall finishes, signage, and canopies, ACP is favored for its smooth surface, uniform quality, and wide range of colors, textures, and finishes, including metallic, matte, glossy, wood-grain, and stone-like appearances. The aluminum skins provide durability, corrosion resistance, and weather protection, while the core contributes to stiffness and impact resistance without adding excessive weight, making ACP easy to transport, fabricate, and install. Panels can be cut, folded, and curved to create clean, modern architectural forms with minimal joints, supporting contemporary design expressions. From a performance standpoint, ACP systems must be carefully detailed for thermal movement, fire safety, and fixing methods, especially in high-rise buildings, where fire-rated cores are essential. Although ACP is not a structural material, its low maintenance requirements, fast installation, and visual consistency make it a popular solution for modern façades and interiors where efficiency, appearance, and design flexibility are priorities.
