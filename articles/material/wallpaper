Wallpaper is a decorative wall covering used to enhance interior spaces by adding color, pattern, texture, and visual interest beyond what paint alone can provide. It is typically made from materials such as paper, vinyl, non-woven fabric, textile, or natural fibers, and is applied to walls using adhesive or pre-pasted backing. Wallpaper offers a wide range of design possibilities, from subtle minimalist textures to bold patterns, murals, and realistic imitations of materials like wood, stone, fabric, or concrete, making it a powerful tool for shaping the character and atmosphere of a room. Functionally, wallpaper can help conceal minor wall imperfections and, in some cases, provide additional durability or moisture resistance, especially with vinyl-coated or washable types used in kitchens, bedrooms, or commercial interiors. Installation requires careful surface preparation and alignment to achieve clean seams and long-lasting results, and removal can be more involved than repainting, depending on the product type. While wallpaper is primarily an aesthetic finish rather than a protective layer, its ability to create distinctive, layered, and expressive interiors makes it a popular choice for feature walls and spaces where design impact is a priority.
