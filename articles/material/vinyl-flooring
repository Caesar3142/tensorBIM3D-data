Vinyl flooring is a synthetic floor covering made primarily from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), designed to be durable, water-resistant, and versatile while offering a wide range of aesthetic options. It is commonly used in residential and commercial interiors because it is comfortable underfoot, easy to install, and relatively affordable compared to natural materials. Vinyl flooring comes in several forms, including sheet vinyl, luxury vinyl tiles (LVT), and luxury vinyl planks (LVP), many of which realistically imitate the appearance of wood, stone, or ceramic through advanced printing and surface texturing. Performance-wise, vinyl flooring is highly resistant to moisture, stains, and wear, making it especially suitable for kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, and high-traffic areas. It also provides good acoustic comfort and thermal comfort, as it is quieter and warmer to walk on than tile or stone. Maintenance is minimal, typically requiring only regular cleaning without special treatments. While vinyl flooring has a higher embodied carbon than natural materials and is petroleum-based, modern products increasingly focus on improved durability, recyclability, and low-VOC emissions. Overall, vinyl flooring offers a practical balance of comfort, durability, design flexibility, and cost efficiency for contemporary interior spaces.
