Fiber cement board is a composite building material made from a mixture of cement, cellulose fibers, sand, and water, engineered to produce strong, durable, and dimensionally stable panels used widely in modern construction. The cement provides strength and resistance to fire, moisture, and impact, while the cellulose fibers act as reinforcement, improving flexibility and reducing brittleness compared to plain cement products. Fiber cement boards are commonly used for exterior cladding, interior wall partitions, ceilings, soffits, and façade panels because they are resistant to rot, termites, mold, and weathering, making them especially suitable for tropical and humid climates. They are lighter than traditional masonry, easy to cut and install with basic tools, and can be finished with paint, texture coatings, or left with a natural cement appearance, allowing both modern and minimalist design expressions. From a performance perspective, fiber cement boards offer good fire resistance, dimensional stability under temperature and humidity changes, and low maintenance over their service life. Although their production involves cement and therefore carries some embodied carbon, their durability, long lifespan, and ability to replace heavier materials make them a practical and efficient solution for contemporary residential and commercial buildings.
