Glass wool is a thermal and acoustic insulation material made from fine fibers of molten glass that are spun into a wool-like texture, creating a lightweight, flexible, and highly effective insulating product widely used in buildings and industrial applications. Its fibrous structure traps air within countless small pockets, significantly reducing heat transfer and sound transmission, which helps improve indoor thermal comfort and reduce noise levels. Glass wool is commonly installed in walls, ceilings, roofs, and HVAC systems, either in batts, rolls, or loose-fill form, and it performs well in both hot and cold climates by limiting heat gain and heat loss. It is non-combustible and offers excellent fire resistance, as glass fibers do not burn and can withstand high temperatures, contributing to building safety. From a sustainability perspective, glass wool is often manufactured using a high percentage of recycled glass and requires relatively low raw material input, although proper handling and protective equipment are necessary during installation to avoid skin and respiratory irritation. Overall, glass wool is a cost-effective, efficient, and widely adopted insulation material that plays a crucial role in energy-efficient and acoustically comfortable building design.
