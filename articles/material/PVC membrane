A PVC membrane is a synthetic waterproofing material made from polyvinyl chloride, widely used for roofing, basements, tunnels, and other structures where long-term water resistance is critical. It is typically manufactured as flexible sheets that are installed using mechanical fastening, adhesion, or loose-lay systems with welded seams, creating a continuous and watertight barrier. PVC membranes are valued for their high resistance to water, chemicals, root penetration, and ultraviolet radiation, making them especially suitable for exposed flat roofs and green roof systems. The material remains flexible over a wide temperature range, allowing it to accommodate thermal movement and minor structural shifts without cracking. PVC membranes are relatively lightweight, which reduces structural load, and their smooth surface helps prevent dirt buildup and supports rainwater drainage. While proper detailing at joints, penetrations, and terminations is essential for performance, PVC membranes offer long service life, consistent quality, and reliable waterproofing, making them a popular choice in modern construction where durability and low maintenance are required.
