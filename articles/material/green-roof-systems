Green roof systems are building roof assemblies that incorporate vegetation layers above a waterproofing membrane, transforming otherwise unused roof surfaces into living landscapes that provide environmental, thermal, and aesthetic benefits. A typical green roof consists of multiple layers, including structural support, waterproofing, root barrier, drainage layer, filter fabric, growing medium, and vegetation, all carefully designed to manage water, protect the building, and support plant life. Green roofs are generally classified as extensive (lightweight, shallow soil, low-maintenance plants like sedum and grasses) or intensive (deeper soil, capable of supporting shrubs or small trees, and accessible as gardens). Functionally, green roofs reduce heat gain by shading the roof surface and through evapotranspiration, improving indoor thermal comfort and lowering cooling energy demand. They also absorb and slow rainwater runoff, reducing pressure on urban drainage systems and helping mitigate flooding during heavy rainfall. Additional benefits include improved acoustic insulation, extended roof membrane lifespan due to UV protection, enhanced urban biodiversity, and improved air quality. While green roof systems require higher upfront cost, structural capacity checks, and proper maintenance planning, their long-term environmental performance, energy savings, and contribution to healthier urban environments make them an increasingly important strategy in sustainable and climate-responsive building design.
