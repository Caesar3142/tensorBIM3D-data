Composite frames are framing systems made from a combination of two or more materials—commonly fiberglass-reinforced polymers (FRP), fiber-reinforced plastics, or hybrid combinations of materials such as resin, fibers, and sometimes metal cores—engineered to achieve performance characteristics that single materials cannot provide alone. In building applications, composite frames are increasingly used for windows, doors, façades, and structural elements because they offer high strength, dimensional stability, corrosion resistance, and excellent thermal performance. Unlike aluminum or steel, composite frames have very low thermal conductivity, which significantly reduces thermal bridging and improves energy efficiency without the need for additional thermal breaks. They are highly resistant to moisture, chemicals, ultraviolet radiation, and temperature fluctuations, making them suitable for harsh climates, coastal environments, and buildings with high durability requirements. Composite frames also maintain their shape over time, resisting warping, expansion, and contraction better than wood or some plastics. Although they tend to have higher upfront costs and more limited design familiarity compared to conventional materials, their long service life, low maintenance needs, and strong thermal and structural performance make composite frames a high-performance, future-oriented solution for energy-efficient and sustainable building envelopes.
