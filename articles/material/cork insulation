Cork insulation is a natural, sustainable insulation material made from the bark of the cork oak tree, which can be harvested repeatedly without harming the tree, making it a renewable and environmentally friendly building product. It is produced by grinding cork bark into granules and bonding them together using natural resins released during heating, without the need for synthetic additives. Cork insulation has excellent thermal performance due to its cellular structure, which traps air and significantly reduces heat transfer, helping maintain comfortable indoor temperatures in both hot and cold climates. It also provides very good acoustic insulation by absorbing sound vibrations, making it effective for reducing noise transmission in walls, floors, and ceilings. Cork is naturally resistant to moisture, mold, insects, and rot, and it does not release toxic gases when exposed to fire, instead charring slowly and contributing to fire safety. In addition, cork insulation is durable, lightweight, and dimensionally stable, maintaining its performance over long periods without shrinking or degrading. With its low embodied carbon, carbon-storing properties, and combination of thermal, acoustic, and health benefits, cork insulation is a premium natural solution for eco-friendly and high-performance building design.
