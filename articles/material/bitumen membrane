A bitumen membrane is a waterproofing material made from bitumen (asphalt) modified with polymers such as APP (atactic polypropylene) or SBS (styrene-butadiene-styrene) to improve flexibility, durability, and resistance to temperature changes, widely used to protect buildings from water penetration. It is commonly applied on flat or low-slope roofs, terraces, balconies, basements, foundations, and wet areas, where reliable waterproofing is critical. Bitumen membranes are typically manufactured as rolls and installed by torch-on (heat-applied), self-adhesive, or cold-applied methods, forming a continuous, watertight barrier when properly bonded and overlapped. The material offers good resistance to moisture, chemicals, and mechanical damage, and reinforced versions using polyester or fiberglass provide added strength and dimensional stability. Bitumen membranes perform well in a wide range of climates, though UV exposure usually requires a protective layer such as screed, tiles, gravel, or reflective coating to extend service life. While derived from petroleum, bitumen membranes are valued for their proven performance, relatively affordable cost, and long service life when correctly detailed and installed, making them one of the most widely used waterproofing solutions in modern construction.
