A glass curtain wall is a non-structural building façade system made primarily of glass panels supported by lightweight frames, typically aluminum, that is hung on the exterior of a building rather than carrying floor or roof loads. Its main function is to enclose the building, protect the interior from weather, and provide natural daylight and views, while transferring wind loads and its own weight back to the building's structural frame. Glass curtain walls are widely used in modern commercial and high-rise buildings because they create a sleek, contemporary appearance and allow large amounts of daylight to penetrate deep into interior spaces, reducing the need for artificial lighting. The system can be designed as stick-built, unitized, or semi-unitized, with unitized systems prefabricated in factories to improve quality control and speed of installation. Performance-wise, curtain walls must carefully address thermal insulation, solar heat gain, air and water tightness, and acoustic performance, often using double or triple glazing, low-emissivity (low-E) coatings, thermal breaks, and integrated shading devices. While glass curtain walls do not provide structural strength, they play a critical role in building energy performance, occupant comfort, and architectural expression, and when properly designed, detailed, and maintained, they offer a balance between transparency, aesthetics, and environmental control in contemporary architecture.
