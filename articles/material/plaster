Plaster is a finishing material used to coat walls and ceilings, creating smooth, durable, and visually refined surfaces in buildings, and it has been a fundamental element of construction for centuries. Traditionally made from lime, gypsum, or cement mixed with water and sometimes sand or fibers, plaster is applied in a wet state and hardens through chemical reactions and drying, forming a solid protective layer over masonry, concrete, or lath substrates. Functionally, plaster improves surface uniformity, protects underlying materials, enhances fire resistance, and contributes to acoustic and thermal comfort by adding mass and sealing gaps. Different types of plaster serve different purposes: lime plaster is breathable and flexible, making it suitable for traditional and heritage buildings; gypsum plaster sets quickly and is commonly used for smooth interior finishes; cement plaster is harder and more moisture-resistant, often used for exterior walls or wet areas. Aesthetically, plaster allows a wide range of finishes, from perfectly smooth modern surfaces to textured, rustic, or decorative effects such as troweled patterns, moldings, and cornices. When properly applied and maintained, plaster provides long-lasting, elegant surfaces that form the visual and tactile foundation of interior and exterior architectural spaces.
