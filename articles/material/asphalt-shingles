Asphalt shingles are a widely used roofing material made from a base of fiberglass or organic felt that is coated with asphalt and topped with mineral granules, creating a flexible, waterproof, and relatively lightweight roofing system. They are popular in residential construction because of their affordability, ease of installation, and wide range of colors, textures, and styles, including designs that mimic wood shakes or slate. Asphalt shingles provide good protection against rain and moderate wind when properly installed, and the mineral granules help protect the asphalt from ultraviolet radiation while also contributing to fire resistance. Compared to tile or metal roofing, asphalt shingles are lighter and require less robust roof structures, which can reduce overall construction cost. However, their lifespan is generally shorter—typically 15 to 30 years—especially in very hot, humid, or high-UV climates where heat and moisture can accelerate aging, curling, or granule loss. From an environmental perspective, asphalt shingles are petroleum-based and less sustainable than some alternatives, although recycling programs are increasingly available in some regions. Overall, asphalt shingles offer a cost-effective, visually versatile roofing option that is well suited for mild to moderate climates and budget-conscious housing projects.
