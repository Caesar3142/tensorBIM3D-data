Extruded polystyrene (XPS) is a rigid foam insulation material made from polystyrene resin through an extrusion process that produces a closed-cell structure with very high density and uniformity, resulting in excellent thermal insulation and moisture resistance. Compared to expanded polystyrene (EPS), XPS has lower water absorption, higher compressive strength, and more consistent performance, which makes it especially suitable for demanding applications such as foundations, basement walls, roofs, inverted roofs, floors, and areas exposed to soil or moisture. Its closed-cell structure effectively limits heat transfer while resisting water penetration, freeze–thaw cycles, and long-term degradation, helping maintain insulation performance over time. XPS boards are lightweight, easy to cut and install, and dimensionally stable, allowing precise construction detailing and reliable thermal envelopes. Because of its strength, XPS can support loads when used under slabs or roof systems without significant deformation. While XPS is a petroleum-based material and has higher embodied carbon than some natural insulation options, its durability, long service life, and high thermal efficiency contribute to reduced operational energy use in buildings. Overall, extruded polystyrene is a high-performance insulation material well suited for energy-efficient construction where strength, moisture resistance, and long-term reliability are critical.
