Glass is a versatile building material used extensively in architecture and construction, with different types engineered to meet specific performance, safety, and energy requirements. **Float glass** is the most basic form, produced by floating molten glass on molten tin to create smooth, flat, and optically clear sheets, commonly used where no special strength or safety is required. **Tempered glass** is heat-treated to increase its strength several times compared to float glass, and when it breaks, it shatters into small, blunt fragments, making it much safer for applications such as doors, windows, façades, and shower enclosures. **Laminated glass** consists of two or more glass layers bonded with an interlayer (such as PVB), which holds the glass together when broken, providing enhanced safety, security, sound insulation, and UV protection, making it ideal for skylights, railings, and noise-sensitive buildings. **Low-emissivity (low-E) glass** is coated with a microscopically thin metallic layer that reflects infrared heat while allowing visible light to pass through, significantly improving thermal performance by reducing heat gain or heat loss, depending on climate. These glass types can also be combined—such as tempered laminated low-E glass—to achieve multiple performance goals at once. Overall, modern glass technology allows buildings to be bright, safe, energy-efficient, and acoustically comfortable while maintaining transparency and strong architectural expression.
