Perforated gypsum board is a specialized interior wall or ceiling panel made from gypsum with regularly spaced holes or slots designed to improve acoustic performance by absorbing sound and reducing echo within a space. The perforations allow sound waves to pass through the board and be absorbed by an acoustic backing material, such as mineral wool or glass wool, installed behind the panel, making the system effective for controlling reverberation and improving speech clarity. Perforated gypsum boards are commonly used in offices, classrooms, auditoriums, meeting rooms, hospitals, and residential media spaces where both acoustic comfort and a clean architectural finish are required. In addition to acoustic benefits, these boards retain the standard advantages of gypsum, including fire resistance, smooth surface quality, and ease of installation on metal or timber framing systems. They are available in various perforation patterns, hole sizes, and finishes, allowing designers to balance sound absorption performance with aesthetic preferences. When properly detailed and combined with appropriate backing insulation, perforated gypsum board provides an integrated solution that enhances acoustic comfort without compromising the simplicity and visual cleanliness of modern interior design.
