Steel frames are structural framing systems made from rolled or cold-formed steel sections that provide strength, stability, and precision in building construction. They are widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings because steel has a very high strength-to-weight ratio, allowing long spans, slender structural members, and flexible interior layouts with fewer load-bearing walls. Steel framing offers consistent quality, dimensional accuracy, and predictable structural behavior, which supports fast construction, prefabrication, and reduced material waste. It performs well under tensile and compressive loads and is especially advantageous for multi-story buildings and structures in seismic or high-wind regions when properly engineered. Steel frames are non-combustible and resistant to termites and rot, though they require corrosion protection through coatings, galvanization, or proper detailing, particularly in humid or coastal environments. While steel has high thermal conductivity and must be combined with proper insulation and thermal breaks to avoid heat transfer issues, its durability, recyclability, and ability to be reused make it a sustainable structural choice over the building's life cycle. Overall, steel frames provide a robust, adaptable, and modern structural solution that supports efficient construction and long-term performance.
