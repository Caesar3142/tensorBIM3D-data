Wood cladding is an exterior or interior finishing system that uses timber boards or panels to cover walls, providing both protection and a warm, natural aesthetic that connects architecture to its surroundings. Commonly made from hardwoods, softwoods, or engineered wood products, wood cladding can be installed in various patterns such as horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or shiplap, allowing flexibility in architectural expression from rustic to modern minimalist styles. Functionally, wood cladding acts as a protective skin that helps shield the building envelope from weather while also contributing to thermal performance when combined with proper backing layers, ventilation gaps, and insulation. A ventilated cavity behind the cladding is especially important, as it allows moisture to escape and prevents rot, significantly improving durability. While wood is lightweight and easy to work with, it requires careful detailing and regular maintenance, including sealing, staining, or oiling, to protect it from moisture, ultraviolet exposure, insects, and fungal attack, particularly in humid or tropical climates. From a sustainability perspective, responsibly sourced wood cladding has low embodied carbon and stores carbon throughout its life cycle, making it an environmentally friendly choice when properly managed. Aesthetically, wood cladding ages gracefully, often developing a natural patina over time, and brings warmth, texture, and human scale to buildings, making it a popular choice for houses that aim to balance modern design with natural comfort and timeless appeal.
