Cementitious waterproofing is a rigid or semi-flexible waterproofing system made from a blend of cement, fine aggregates, and chemical additives that react with water to form a dense, impermeable barrier. It is typically supplied as a powder or a two-component system (cement-based powder combined with liquid polymer) and applied as a slurry or coating to concrete and masonry surfaces. Cementitious waterproofing works by penetrating pores and capillaries in the substrate and blocking water ingress, making it especially suitable for areas that are constantly exposed to moisture such as basements, water tanks, bathrooms, toilets, swimming pools, and foundations. One of its key advantages is ease of application, as it can be applied to damp surfaces and does not require complex tools or equipment. It also bonds well to concrete and masonry and is compatible with subsequent finishes like tiles or screeds. However, traditional cementitious waterproofing is relatively rigid and has limited ability to accommodate structural movement or cracking unless polymer-modified versions are used. Overall, cementitious waterproofing is a cost-effective, durable, and widely used solution for protecting structures against water penetration, particularly where simplicity, compatibility with concrete, and long-term reliability are required.
