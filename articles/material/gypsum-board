Gypsum board, also known as drywall or plasterboard, is a lightweight building panel made from a core of gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) sandwiched between layers of paper, widely used for interior walls and ceilings in residential and commercial construction. It is favored for its ease of installation, smooth finish, and cost efficiency compared to traditional plaster systems, allowing fast construction with minimal wet work. Gypsum board provides good fire resistance because gypsum contains chemically bound water that is released as steam when exposed to heat, slowing fire spread, and specialized variants are available for enhanced performance, such as moisture-resistant boards for bathrooms, fire-rated boards for safety zones, and acoustic boards for sound control. The system is typically installed on metal or timber framing, making it flexible for modern layouts, renovations, and concealed services like electrical wiring and HVAC ducts. Gypsum board surfaces can be painted, wallpapered, or finished with textures, offering high design flexibility for interiors. While it is not suitable for structural use and can be damaged by prolonged moisture exposure, proper detailing and material selection make it a durable and practical interior solution. Overall, gypsum board is a key component of modern construction, valued for its speed, versatility, clean appearance, and contribution to fire safety and interior comfort.
