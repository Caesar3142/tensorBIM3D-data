Metal roofing, including steel, zinc, and aluminum systems, is a lightweight and durable roofing solution widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings due to its strength, longevity, and versatility. Steel roofing, often coated with zinc (galvanized) or aluminum-zinc alloy (galvalume), offers high strength and good resistance to corrosion at a relatively affordable cost, making it one of the most common choices. Aluminum roofing is naturally corrosion-resistant, especially in coastal or humid environments, and is much lighter than steel, reducing structural load, though it is typically more expensive. Zinc roofing is valued for its premium quality and long lifespan, as it develops a natural protective patina over time that heals scratches and protects against corrosion, often lasting 50–100 years with minimal maintenance. Metal roofing reflects a significant portion of solar radiation, helping reduce heat gain, and when combined with insulation and ventilation layers, it performs very well in hot climates. It is also highly resistant to fire, wind, and heavy rain, and its large panel formats allow fast installation with fewer joints, reducing leak risk. From a sustainability perspective, metal roofing is recyclable, often contains recycled content, and supports rainwater harvesting due to its smooth, clean surface. Aesthetically, metal roofing suits both modern minimalist and traditional designs, available in standing seam, corrugated, and shingle-like profiles, making it a flexible, long-lasting, and energy-efficient roofing option.
