Aerogel is an advanced, ultra-lightweight insulation material often described as a “solid smoke” because of its translucent appearance and extremely low density, developed by removing the liquid component of a gel and replacing it with air while preserving the gel’s nanostructure. This structure consists of up to 99.8% air trapped within a network of nanoscale pores, which gives aerogel one of the lowest thermal conductivity values of any known solid material, making it exceptionally effective at reducing heat transfer even in very thin layers. In advanced building and industrial applications, aerogel is used where space is limited but high insulation performance is required, such as high-performance façades, retrofit insulation for heritage buildings, curtain wall spandrels, skylights, pipelines, aerospace components, and extreme-temperature environments. Aerogel products are commonly available as blankets, boards, plasters, or translucent panels, often reinforced with fibers to improve handling strength and flexibility. In addition to thermal insulation, aerogel offers excellent acoustic absorption, hydrophobic behavior (repelling water while remaining vapor permeable), and good fire resistance, depending on formulation. Although aerogel has significantly higher upfront cost compared to conventional insulation materials, its ability to deliver superior performance with minimal thickness, reduce thermal bridges, and enable innovative architectural and engineering solutions makes it a critical material in cutting-edge, energy-efficient, and high-tech applications.
