Steel is a versatile and widely used engineering material primarily composed of iron alloyed with a small amount of carbon, typically between 0.02% and 2%, which dramatically improves its strength, hardness, and durability compared to pure iron while maintaining good ductility and workability. It is produced through processes such as basic oxygen steelmaking or electric arc furnaces, where impurities are removed and alloying elements like manganese, chromium, nickel, or molybdenum may be added to tailor properties for specific applications. Steel is prized for its high tensile and compressive strength, predictable behavior, and ability to undergo significant deformation before failure, making it especially reliable for structural applications where safety is critical. Because of these characteristics, steel is extensively used in buildings, bridges, industrial structures, machinery, vehicles, pipelines, and tools, often forming the primary load-bearing framework of modern infrastructure. Its uniform quality and compatibility with prefabrication allow precise manufacturing, fast construction, and efficient use of material, while its recyclability—steel can be recycled repeatedly without significant loss of properties—makes it one of the most sustainable structural materials available. However, steel is susceptible to corrosion when exposed to moisture and oxygen, so protective measures such as coatings, galvanization, alloying (as in stainless steel), or controlled environments are necessary to ensure long-term durability. Overall, steel's combination of strength, flexibility, reliability, and recyclability has made it a cornerstone of modern engineering and architecture, enabling everything from slender high-rise towers to heavy industrial systems and complex mechanical components.
