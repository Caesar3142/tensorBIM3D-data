Polyurethane foam (PU foam) is a high-performance insulation material created by a chemical reaction between polyols and isocyanates, producing a rigid or flexible foam with a predominantly closed-cell structure that provides excellent thermal insulation. It is widely used in buildings for roof, wall, floor, and cavity insulation because it has one of the lowest thermal conductivity values among common insulation materials, allowing high insulation performance with relatively thin layers. PU foam can be applied as rigid boards or sprayed in place, where it expands to fill gaps, joints, and irregular surfaces, creating a continuous, airtight thermal barrier that significantly reduces heat transfer and air leakage. Its closed-cell structure also provides good moisture resistance and adds some structural rigidity to assemblies, making it especially effective for roofs and building envelopes in hot or cold climates. Polyurethane foam performs well over long periods without significant settling or loss of insulation value, contributing to reduced energy consumption for heating and cooling. However, it is petroleum-based and has higher embodied carbon than some natural insulation materials, and careful installation and ventilation are required due to chemical sensitivity during application. Despite these considerations, PU foam is valued for its superior insulation efficiency, space-saving properties, and ability to improve overall building energy performance when used thoughtfully in modern construction.
