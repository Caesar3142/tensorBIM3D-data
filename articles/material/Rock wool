Rock wool, also known as mineral wool or stone wool, is a thermal and acoustic insulation material manufactured by melting natural rock such as basalt or industrial slag at very high temperatures and spinning the molten material into dense, fibrous strands. This fiber structure traps air effectively, giving rock wool excellent thermal insulation performance that helps reduce heat transfer in both hot and cold climates, making buildings more energy efficient. Rock wool is also highly valued for its superior acoustic absorption, as its density and fiber arrangement are very effective at reducing noise transmission and reverberation in walls, ceilings, and floors. One of its most important advantages is fire resistance: rock wool is non-combustible and can withstand extremely high temperatures without melting or producing toxic smoke, significantly improving building fire safety. It is resistant to moisture, mold, and pests, and maintains its shape and performance over time without shrinking or settling. Commonly used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings for walls, roofs, façades, and fire-rated partitions, rock wool combines durability, safety, and performance. Although it is heavier and slightly more expensive than some other insulation materials, its long lifespan, fire protection, and acoustic benefits make rock wool a high-performance and reliable choice for modern, energy-efficient building design.
