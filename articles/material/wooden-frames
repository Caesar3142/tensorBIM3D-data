Wooden frames are structural framing systems made from solid timber or engineered wood products, widely used in residential and low-rise construction because of their natural strength, workability, and warm aesthetic qualities. Wood has an excellent strength-to-weight ratio and performs well in both compression and tension along the grain, making it suitable for columns, beams, studs, joists, and roof structures. Wooden framing systems are easy to fabricate, modify, and repair on site, allowing flexibility in design and construction, especially for houses and small buildings. From a comfort perspective, wood has low thermal conductivity compared to steel or aluminum, which helps reduce thermal bridging and contributes to better indoor thermal performance. Wood also naturally regulates humidity by absorbing and releasing moisture, improving indoor air quality and comfort. However, wooden frames require proper detailing and protection against moisture, termites, fungi, and fire through treatments, coatings, and good construction practices. When sourced from sustainably managed forests or used in engineered forms such as glulam or laminated timber, wooden frames are a renewable, carbon-storing, and environmentally responsible structural solution that combines performance, sustainability, and a timeless architectural character.
