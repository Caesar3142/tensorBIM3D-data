Porcelain tiles are a high-performance type of ceramic tile made from refined clay and minerals that are pressed under high pressure and fired at very high temperatures, resulting in an extremely dense, hard, and low-porosity material. Because of this manufacturing process, porcelain tiles absorb very little water, making them highly resistant to moisture, stains, frost, and chemical attack, which allows them to be used both indoors and outdoors, including in bathrooms, kitchens, façades, and high-traffic commercial areas. They offer excellent mechanical strength and abrasion resistance, making them more durable than standard ceramic tiles and suitable for areas subjected to heavy use. Aesthetically, porcelain tiles are available in a wide variety of finishes, sizes, and textures, including realistic imitations of natural stone, marble, wood, and concrete, while maintaining consistent quality and color throughout the tile body. In terms of comfort and performance, porcelain tiles have high thermal mass and conductivity, helping interiors feel cool in hot climates, and they are compatible with underfloor heating systems in cooler regions. Although porcelain tiles are generally more expensive and harder to cut and install than ceramic tiles due to their density, their durability, low maintenance requirements, and long service life make them a cost-effective and versatile flooring and wall solution over the long term.
