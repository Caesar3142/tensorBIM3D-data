Soundproof glass, most commonly in the form of laminated glass, is a high-performance glazing system designed to reduce noise transmission while maintaining transparency and safety. It is made by bonding two or more layers of glass with one or more interlayers of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) or specialized acoustic interlayers, which dampen sound vibrations as they pass through the glass assembly. Unlike standard glass, laminated soundproof glass reduces noise by disrupting sound wave energy and converting part of it into heat within the interlayer, making it particularly effective against traffic noise, aircraft noise, and urban background sounds. The level of sound insulation depends on factors such as glass thickness, asymmetry between layers, and the type of acoustic interlayer used, with higher-performance systems achieving significant reductions in decibel levels. In addition to acoustic benefits, laminated soundproof glass improves safety by holding shards together when broken, enhances UV protection, and can be combined with thermal coatings for energy efficiency. Widely used in residential buildings, offices, hotels, hospitals, and buildings near noisy environments, soundproof laminated glass provides a balance of comfort, safety, and daylight, making it a key component in modern high-performance building envelopes.
