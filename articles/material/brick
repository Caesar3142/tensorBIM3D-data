Brick is a traditional masonry material made by shaping clay into rectangular units and hardening them through firing in a kiln, resulting in a durable, strong, and dimensionally stable building element that has been used in construction for thousands of years. Structurally, brick performs very well in compression and is commonly used for load-bearing walls, partitions, façades, and paving, either alone or in combination with reinforced concrete or steel frames. Bricks are laid with mortar, which bonds the units together, distributes loads, and accommodates minor movements due to temperature changes or settlement. One of brick's key advantages is its high thermal mass, which helps regulate indoor temperatures by absorbing heat during the day and releasing it slowly at night, improving comfort in many climates. Brick is also highly resistant to fire, weathering, pests, and ultraviolet exposure, making it a low-maintenance and long-lasting material. Aesthetically, brick offers a wide range of colors, textures, and bonding patterns, allowing it to suit both traditional and modern architectural styles, from exposed fair-faced brickwork to plastered or painted finishes. While brick production requires significant energy for firing, its durability, potential for reuse, and availability of local clay sources make it a practical and culturally significant material that continues to play a major role in residential and commercial construction worldwide.
