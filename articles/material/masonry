Masonry is a traditional construction system that uses individual units such as bricks, concrete blocks, stone, or clay blocks laid together with mortar to form walls, piers, and structural elements, and it has been one of the most enduring building methods in human history. The strength of masonry comes primarily from its high compressive capacity, durability, and mass, making it especially suitable for load-bearing walls, boundary walls, and buildings designed for long service life. Mortar, typically made from cement or lime, sand, and water, plays a critical role by bonding units together, distributing loads, accommodating small movements, and sealing joints against moisture penetration. Masonry performs very well in fire resistance, acoustic insulation, and thermal mass, helping stabilize indoor temperatures by absorbing heat during the day and releasing it slowly at night. While traditional unreinforced masonry is weak in tension and vulnerable to seismic forces, modern masonry construction often incorporates reinforcement, grout, and structural ties to significantly improve strength, ductility, and safety. Masonry is valued for its low maintenance, availability of local materials, and aesthetic versatility, ranging from rustic stonework to clean, modern block or brick finishes, making it a practical and culturally significant material in both historical and contemporary architecture.
