uPVC frames are window and door framing systems made from unplasticized polyvinyl chloride, a rigid and durable plastic material designed for long-term performance in building envelopes. They are valued for their excellent resistance to moisture, corrosion, termites, and weathering, making them especially suitable for humid, tropical, and coastal environments where metal or timber frames may degrade more quickly. uPVC frames have low thermal conductivity, which gives them good natural insulation properties and helps reduce heat transfer, improving indoor thermal comfort and energy efficiency without the need for additional thermal breaks. They also provide good acoustic insulation when combined with appropriate glazing, helping reduce outside noise. uPVC frames require very little maintenance, as they do not need painting and can be easily cleaned, though prolonged exposure to intense sunlight may require UV-stabilized formulations to prevent discoloration. While they are bulkier in appearance compared to aluminum frames and offer fewer color and finish options, uPVC frames are cost-effective, durable, and practical, making them a popular choice for residential buildings focused on comfort, efficiency, and low maintenance.
