Aluminum is a lightweight, non-ferrous metal known for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and versatility, making it one of the most widely used materials in modern construction, transportation, and manufacturing. It is extracted primarily from bauxite ore through energy-intensive refining and smelting processes, but once produced, aluminum can be recycled repeatedly with minimal loss of properties, requiring only a fraction of the energy needed for primary production. Structurally, aluminum is much lighter than steel yet sufficiently strong for many applications, which reduces dead loads and makes handling, transport, and installation easier. In buildings, aluminum is commonly used for window and door frames, curtain walls, louvers, roofing sheets, façades, shading devices, and interior elements because it does not rust, performs well in humid or coastal environments, and requires very little maintenance. Its surface can be anodized, painted, or powder-coated to improve durability and aesthetics, offering a wide range of finishes and colors suitable for contemporary architectural design. Aluminum also has high thermal conductivity, which must be carefully managed with thermal breaks in building envelopes to prevent heat transfer, but this same property makes it valuable in heat exchangers and cooling systems. Overall, aluminum's combination of lightness, durability, recyclability, and design flexibility makes it a key material in modern, energy-efficient, and sustainable construction and engineering applications.
