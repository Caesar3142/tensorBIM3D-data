Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a lightweight, rigid foam insulation material made from polystyrene beads that are expanded using steam and then molded into blocks or panels, creating a closed-cell structure filled mostly with air. This trapped air gives EPS excellent thermal insulation properties, making it effective at reducing heat transfer in walls, roofs, floors, and façades, and helping improve building energy efficiency. EPS is widely used in construction for insulation boards, insulated concrete forms (ICFs), sandwich panels, and packaging because it is light, easy to cut and shape, and simple to install with minimal labor. It also provides some level of impact resistance and moisture resistance, as it does not readily absorb water, although prolonged exposure to moisture and ultraviolet light should be avoided without proper protection. From a structural standpoint, EPS is not load-bearing on its own but performs well when combined with concrete or other structural systems. While EPS is petroleum-based, it is recyclable and has relatively low embodied energy compared to some other insulation materials due to its low density and efficient thermal performance over its service life. Overall, expanded polystyrene is a cost-effective, versatile, and widely adopted insulation solution in modern building construction.
