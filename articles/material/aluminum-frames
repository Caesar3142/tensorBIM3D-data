Aluminum frames are structural and framing components made from extruded aluminum profiles, widely used in windows, doors, curtain walls, partitions, and façade systems because of their light weight, strength, and corrosion resistance. Aluminum does not rust and performs especially well in humid, tropical, or coastal environments, making it a durable and low-maintenance choice for building envelopes. The material is strong relative to its weight, allowing slim frame profiles that maximize glass area and daylight while maintaining structural integrity. Aluminum frames can be finished with anodizing or powder coating, providing long-lasting color, improved surface protection, and a wide range of aesthetic options suitable for modern and minimalist architecture. From a performance perspective, aluminum has high thermal conductivity, so high-quality systems incorporate thermal breaks—non-conductive inserts within the frame—to reduce heat transfer and improve energy efficiency. Aluminum is also highly recyclable, retaining its properties through repeated recycling with low additional energy use, which contributes to sustainability. Overall, aluminum frames offer a balance of durability, precision, design flexibility, and long-term performance, making them a standard solution in contemporary building design.
