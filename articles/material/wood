Wood is a natural, renewable construction material derived from trees, composed primarily of cellulose fibers bound together by lignin, which gives it a unique combination of strength, flexibility, and lightness that has been used by humans for thousands of years. Structurally, wood performs exceptionally well relative to its weight, offering good compressive and tensile strength along the grain, making it suitable for beams, columns, floors, roofs, and framing systems in residential and light commercial buildings. Beyond its mechanical properties, wood is valued for its natural thermal insulation, low embodied energy, and ability to regulate indoor humidity by absorbing and releasing moisture, contributing to healthier and more comfortable living environments. It is easy to work with, adaptable to both traditional and modern construction methods, and can be engineered into products such as plywood, laminated veneer lumber (LVL), glue-laminated timber (glulam), and cross-laminated timber (CLT), which greatly expand its structural capacity and dimensional stability. Aesthetically, wood provides warmth, texture, and visual comfort that many materials cannot match, making it popular not only for structure but also for interiors, finishes, furniture, and architectural detailing. From an environmental perspective, responsibly sourced wood acts as a carbon sink, storing carbon dioxide absorbed during tree growth, although durability depends on proper detailing, protection from moisture, insects, and fungi, and regular maintenance. When used thoughtfully, wood offers a rare balance of sustainability, performance, and human comfort, making it one of the most enduring and emotionally resonant materials in architecture and engineering.
