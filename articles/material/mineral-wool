Mineral wool is a broad category of fibrous insulation materials that includes rock wool (stone wool) and glass wool, manufactured by melting natural rock, slag, or recycled glass at high temperatures and spinning the molten material into fine fibers. This fibrous structure traps air effectively, giving mineral wool excellent thermal insulation properties that help reduce heat transfer and improve energy efficiency in buildings across both hot and cold climates. Mineral wool is also highly regarded for its acoustic performance, as its density and open fiber structure absorb sound waves and reduce noise transmission through walls, floors, and ceilings. One of its most important advantages is fire resistance: mineral wool is non-combustible, can withstand very high temperatures, and does not contribute to flame spread or toxic smoke, significantly enhancing building fire safety. It is resistant to moisture, mold, pests, and dimensional changes, maintaining its performance over long periods without shrinking or settling when properly installed. Commonly used in walls, roofs, façades, partitions, and HVAC systems, mineral wool combines durability, safety, and comfort, making it a reliable and widely used insulation solution in modern residential, commercial, and industrial construction.
