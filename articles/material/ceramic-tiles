Ceramic tiles are hard, durable surface materials made from natural clay that is shaped, glazed or unglazed, and fired at high temperatures to create dense, water-resistant tiles commonly used for floors, walls, bathrooms, kitchens, and façades. They are valued for their durability, ease of maintenance, and resistance to moisture, stains, chemicals, and fire, making them especially suitable for wet areas and high-traffic spaces. Ceramic tiles come in a wide range of sizes, colors, textures, and finishes—from glossy and matte surfaces to designs that mimic natural stone, wood, or concrete—allowing great flexibility in architectural and interior design. Glazed ceramic tiles have an additional protective layer that improves water resistance and stain protection, while unglazed tiles rely on their natural density and surface treatment for performance. In terms of comfort, ceramic tiles have high thermal conductivity and thermal mass, meaning they feel cool underfoot and help regulate indoor temperatures in hot climates, although they may feel cold in cooler environments. From a sustainability perspective, ceramic tiles are made from abundant natural materials and have a long service life, reducing replacement frequency, though their production requires significant energy for firing. Overall, ceramic tiles are a practical, hygienic, and versatile finishing material that balances performance, aesthetics, and longevity in both residential and commercial buildings.
