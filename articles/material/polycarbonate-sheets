Polycarbonate sheets are lightweight, transparent or translucent thermoplastic panels known for their high impact resistance, durability, and excellent light-transmitting properties, making them widely used in roofing, skylights, canopies, façades, and partitions. Compared to glass, polycarbonate is much lighter and up to hundreds of times more impact-resistant, which makes it safer and less prone to breakage while still allowing a high percentage of natural daylight to pass through. These sheets are available in solid, multiwall, or corrugated forms, with multiwall polycarbonate offering improved thermal insulation due to internal air gaps that reduce heat transfer. Polycarbonate sheets are commonly treated with UV-protective coatings to prevent yellowing, degradation, and loss of strength when exposed to sunlight, extending their service life in outdoor applications. They perform well in humid and rainy climates, are easy to cut and install, and can be cold-bent to create curved forms, offering great design flexibility. However, polycarbonate has higher thermal expansion than glass or metal and requires proper detailing at joints and fixings to prevent warping or leakage. While it does not provide the same acoustic or thermal mass benefits as heavier materials, polycarbonate is valued for its ability to bring in diffused natural light, reduce the need for artificial lighting during the day, and create bright, airy spaces in both residential and commercial buildings.
