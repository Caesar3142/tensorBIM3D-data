Concrete is a composite construction material made by mixing cement, water, fine aggregates (such as sand), and coarse aggregates (such as gravel or crushed stone), which together form a workable mixture that can be molded into almost any shape and then hardens into a strong, stone-like mass through the hydration of cement. The cement acts as a binder, coating and gluing the aggregates together, while water initiates chemical reactions that create calcium silicate hydrate, the primary source of concrete's strength and durability. Concrete is valued for its high compressive strength, fire resistance, long service life, and versatility, making it the most widely used man-made material in the world, applied in buildings, roads, bridges, dams, foundations, and infrastructure of all scales. Its properties can be tailored by adjusting mix proportions, water–cement ratio, aggregate grading, and by adding admixtures such as plasticizers, retarders, accelerators, or air-entraining agents to improve workability, strength development, durability, or resistance to freezing and chemical attack. Although concrete is inherently weak in tension and brittle, this limitation is commonly overcome by reinforcing it with steel bars or mesh, creating reinforced concrete, or by using prestressing techniques that introduce compressive stresses to counteract tensile forces. Proper curing—maintaining adequate moisture and temperature after placement—is critical to achieving desired strength and minimizing cracking. From a sustainability perspective, concrete's environmental impact is closely tied to cement production, but its durability, thermal mass, and potential use of recycled aggregates and supplementary cementitious materials make it a key focus area for low-carbon construction innovation.
