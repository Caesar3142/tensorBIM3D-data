Reflective foil insulation is a thin insulation material typically made from aluminum foil layers bonded to kraft paper, plastic film, or foam substrates, designed to reduce heat transfer primarily by reflecting radiant heat rather than resisting conductive heat flow. Its shiny, low-emissivity surface reflects a high percentage of radiant energy, making it especially effective in hot climates where solar radiation is a major source of heat gain. Reflective foil insulation works best when installed facing an air gap, such as under roofing, above ceilings, or within wall cavities, because the air space allows radiant heat to be reflected away rather than conducted through solid materials. It is lightweight, easy to install, and commonly used in residential roofs, metal roofing systems, warehouses, and agricultural buildings to improve thermal comfort and reduce cooling energy demand. While reflective foil has limited insulating value on its own for conductive heat transfer compared to bulk insulation like mineral wool or foam, it is highly effective when combined with other insulation materials as part of a layered system. Durable, moisture-resistant, and often recyclable, reflective foil insulation is a cost-effective solution for reducing radiant heat, improving energy efficiency, and enhancing indoor comfort when properly detailed and installed.
