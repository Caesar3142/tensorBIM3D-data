## Sunken slab design ##

A sunken slab design in a bathroom involves lowering the floor level of the wet area, such as a shower or wet room, below the surrounding floor. This creates a natural drainage slope toward floor drains, allowing water to flow efficiently without the need for raised platforms or curbs. Sunken slabs help contain water within the wet zone, reducing the risk of overflow into dry areas, and can simplify the installation of waterproofing layers and tile finishes. Proper structural support, waterproofing, and coordination with plumbing and drainage lines are essential to ensure durability, prevent leaks, and maintain safe, slip-resistant surfaces.
