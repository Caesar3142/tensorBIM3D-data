## Cost breakdown ##

Cost breakdown in a bathroom typically includes several key components: the plumbing system, which covers pipes, fittings, drains, and installation labor; fixtures and sanitaryware, such as toilets, sinks, bathtubs, showers, and faucets; finishes, including tiles, wall treatments, flooring, and waterproofing; cabinetry, vanities, mirrors, and storage; electrical and lighting work, including wiring, switches, outlets, and ventilation; and labor costs for demolition, installation, and finishing. Additional expenses may include permits, waterproofing membranes, insulation, and accessories like grab bars or towel rails. The proportion of costs varies depending on bathroom size, materials chosen, and the level of luxury or customization desired.
