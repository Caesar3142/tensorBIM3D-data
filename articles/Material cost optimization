## Material cost optimization ##

Material cost optimization in bathroom design involves selecting durable, functional, and aesthetically pleasing materials while minimizing expenses. Strategies include choosing standard-size tiles to reduce cutting and waste, using prefabricated or modular fixtures instead of custom-made items, and selecting materials that balance quality and price, such as ceramic instead of natural stone or acrylic instead of cast iron for bathtubs. Grouping wet zones to simplify plumbing, reusing existing structural elements where possible, and buying in bulk or from cost-effective suppliers also reduce costs. Careful planning of layouts, finishes, and quantities ensures minimal waste, lower labor costs, and a functional, visually appealing bathroom within budget.
