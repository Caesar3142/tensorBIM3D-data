## Scandinavian bathroom ##

A Scandinavian bathroom emphasizes simplicity, functionality, and natural light, creating a calm and inviting atmosphere. Color schemes are typically light and neutral, with whites, soft grays, and pale woods dominating the space. Fixtures are minimal and streamlined, often wall-mounted or freestanding, with clean lines and practical storage solutions to reduce clutter. Natural materials, such as wood accents and stone tiles, are used to add warmth, while large mirrors and ample lighting enhance brightness. The design balances aesthetics with comfort, incorporating efficient layouts, easy-to-clean surfaces, and subtle decorative elements for a cozy, modern bathroom.
