## Electrical zoning ##

Electrical zoning in a bathroom involves dividing the space into areas based on proximity to water sources to ensure safety and compliance with regulations. Zones are typically defined around showers, bathtubs, sinks, and other wet areas. Zone 0 is inside the bathtub or shower tray, Zone 1 is the area directly above the tray or shower floor up to 2.25 meters, and Zone 2 extends 0.6 meters beyond Zone 1. Electrical fixtures and devices must meet specific safety requirements in each zone, including minimum IP ratings, isolation from mains voltage, or use of low-voltage systems. Proper zoning reduces the risk of electric shock, protects equipment from moisture, and ensures a safe bathroom environment.
