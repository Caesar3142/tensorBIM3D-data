## Slip-resistant flooring ##

Slip-resistant flooring in bathrooms is designed to reduce the risk of falls in wet areas. Materials commonly used include textured ceramic or porcelain tiles, natural stone with a rough finish, vinyl with embossed patterns, and rubber flooring. The surface should provide adequate traction even when wet, often measured by a coefficient of friction rating. Small-format tiles with more grout lines can also improve grip, and mats or treads may be added in showers or near tubs. Proper installation, drainage, and maintenance are essential to ensure the flooring remains effective, safe, and durable over time.
