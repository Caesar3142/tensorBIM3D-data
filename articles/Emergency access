## Emergency access ##

Emergency access in a bathroom involves designing the space so that assistance can be provided quickly and safely in case of an accident or medical emergency. This includes maintaining clear floor space and unobstructed pathways for caregivers or emergency personnel to reach a person in distress. Doors should open outward or be wide enough to allow entry with mobility aids, and fixtures should be positioned to avoid blocking access. Installing grab bars, accessible controls, and non-slip flooring further enhances safety. Emergency access planning is especially important in bathrooms designed for elderly or disabled users, ensuring rapid and safe intervention when needed.
