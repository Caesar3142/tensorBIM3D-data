## Shower area waterproofing ##

Shower area waterproofing involves applying a continuous barrier on floors and walls to prevent water from penetrating into the structure. The waterproofing layer typically covers the shower floor, extending up the walls at least 72 inches or to the full height of the shower, and includes corners, joints, and penetrations around pipes and fixtures. Proper slope toward the drain ensures water flows efficiently, while membranes or coatings—such as liquid-applied, sheet, or cementitious types—create a durable seal. Seams, edges, and transitions are reinforced with tapes or sealants to maintain continuity, protecting the subfloor and walls from leaks, mold, and long-term water damage.
