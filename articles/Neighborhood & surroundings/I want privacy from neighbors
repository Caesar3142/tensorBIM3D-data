## I want privacy from neighbors ##

To achieve privacy from neighbors, design the house with controlled openings and inward-focused spaces rather than large exposed side windows. Position major windows toward a private garden, courtyard, or the front and rear of the lot instead of directly facing adjacent properties. Use high-level windows, clerestory glazing, or frosted glass on side walls to allow daylight while blocking direct views. Incorporate boundary walls, dense landscaping, vertical screens, or perforated façades to create visual buffers without sacrificing ventilation. An L-shaped or courtyard layout can also shield outdoor spaces from surrounding houses. Careful placement of bedrooms and bathrooms away from shared boundaries further enhances privacy. By combining strategic window orientation, screening elements, and thoughtful spatial planning, you can maintain comfort and natural light while minimizing exposure to neighbors.
