## Create a compact house design for urban area with limited space ##

A compact house design for an urban area with limited space should prioritize vertical development, efficient circulation, and multi-functional spaces to maximize usability without feeling cramped. The layout can adopt a two- to three-story configuration on a narrow lot, with the ground floor dedicated to an open-plan living, dining, and kitchen area to create visual spaciousness, complemented by large windows and sliding glass doors for natural light and cross-ventilation. Built-in storage under stairs, wall-mounted cabinets, and foldable or modular furniture help reduce clutter. The upper floors can accommodate bedrooms and a compact bathroom, with skylights or light wells to enhance daylight penetration in dense neighborhoods. A small rooftop terrace or balcony can serve as a private outdoor space for relaxation, gardening, or utility functions such as laundry. Using a minimalist architectural style, neutral color palettes, and smart space planning ensures the house remains comfortable, functional, and aesthetically pleasing despite spatial constraints.
