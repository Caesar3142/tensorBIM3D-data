Yes, the toilet can be placed under the staircase, and in small or compact houses this is actually a very common and practical solution. When designed properly, it uses otherwise wasted space and helps keep the overall layout efficient without sacrificing comfort.

The main requirement is sufficient headroom. Even though the space under the stairs slopes, the toilet area must meet minimum head clearance, especially above the toilet bowl and in the main standing zone. Typically, the lowest point of the ceiling should still allow a comfortable seated position, while the entrance area should have near full standing height. This usually means placing the toilet pan toward the lower end and the door toward the higher end of the stair.

Ventilation is critical. Toilets generate moisture and odors, so an under-stair toilet must have good ventilation. Ideally, it should connect to an external wall, a rear yard, a side setback, or a light well. If natural ventilation is not possible, a strong mechanical exhaust fan is mandatory. Poorly ventilated under-stair toilets are one of the most common sources of long-term odor and humidity problems.

Plumbing coordination must be planned early. Under-stair toilets work best when they are close to other wet areas, such as a bathroom above or a nearby kitchen, so plumbing runs are short and simple. This reduces construction cost and minimizes the risk of leaks. The stair structure itself must also be coordinated so beams or stringers do not clash with pipes.

Door placement and privacy need attention. The toilet door should not open directly into the living or dining area if possible. Even a small offset, short corridor, or visual screen makes a big difference in comfort. Using a sliding or pocket door is often a good choice because it saves space and avoids awkward door swings in tight areas.

In terms of size, an under-stair toilet is best kept compact and used as a guest or secondary toilet rather than a full bathroom. A minimum footprint of around 1.2 × 1.5 meters can work for a toilet and small hand basin if carefully detailed. Light colors, good lighting, and simple finishes help prevent the space from feeling cramped.

In summary, placing a toilet under the staircase is perfectly acceptable and often very smart in a small house. As long as headroom, ventilation, plumbing, and privacy are handled properly, it becomes a highly efficient use of space rather than a compromise.
