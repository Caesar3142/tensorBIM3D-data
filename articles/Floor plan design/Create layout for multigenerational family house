## Create layout for multigenerational family house ##

A multigenerational family house should be organized with clear zoning to balance togetherness and privacy, typically by separating spaces for elderly members, parents, and children while maintaining shared communal areas. The ground floor should include a bedroom with an accessible bathroom for elderly family members to avoid stairs, along with the main living room, dining area, and kitchen as central gathering spaces. The upper floor can accommodate the master bedroom and children’s bedrooms, possibly with a small family lounge to create a secondary private living area. If space allows, consider a semi-independent suite with a small pantry or sitting area for grandparents to enhance autonomy. Bathrooms should be strategically stacked for plumbing efficiency, and sound insulation between floors improves comfort. Outdoor areas such as a shared garden or terrace can serve as neutral gathering zones. The overall layout should prioritize easy circulation, minimal level changes for seniors, and flexible spaces that can adapt as family needs evolve over time.
