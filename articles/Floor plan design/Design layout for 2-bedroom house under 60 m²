## Design layout for 2-bedroom house under 60 m² ##

A 2-bedroom house under 60 m² should prioritize an open-plan layout, efficient circulation, and minimal hallway space to maximize usability. A practical configuration is a rectangular footprint of approximately 6 × 9 meters (54 m²) or 5 × 11 meters (55 m²). The front portion can serve as a combined living and dining area (about 3 × 3.5 m), seamlessly connected to a compact linear or L-shaped kitchen to avoid visual crowding. The two bedrooms can be positioned at the rear or along one side of the house for privacy, with the master bedroom around 3 × 3 meters and the second bedroom approximately 2.5 × 3 meters. A shared bathroom (about 1.5 × 2.4 meters) should be centrally located to minimize plumbing runs and allow easy access from both bedrooms. Sliding doors, built-in wardrobes, and multipurpose furniture help reduce spatial waste, while large windows and possibly a small rear yard or light well improve ventilation and natural lighting. Keeping circulation space under 10–15% of total floor area ensures the design remains efficient, comfortable, and functional within the compact size limit.
