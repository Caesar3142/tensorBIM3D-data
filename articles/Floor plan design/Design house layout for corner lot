## Design house layout for corner lot ##

For a corner lot, the house layout should take advantage of dual street frontage by positioning the main entrance on the quieter street while placing vehicular access and garage on the secondary street to reduce traffic conflict. Orient the living and dining areas toward the more private side of the lot, using large windows to capture light from two directions while maintaining privacy with landscaping or boundary walls. Bedrooms can be located along the side farthest from street noise, preferably facing an internal garden or backyard. The corner condition also allows for L-shaped layouts, creating a sheltered courtyard or private outdoor space that buffers the house from both streets. Maximizing cross-ventilation and natural light from two open sides enhances comfort, while careful window placement and screening maintain security and privacy.
