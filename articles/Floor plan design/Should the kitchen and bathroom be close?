Yes, the kitchen and bathroom can be close to each other, and from a design and construction point of view, this is often a very good idea. However, they should be close in terms of plumbing and services, not necessarily directly adjacent in daily use. The distinction between technical closeness and functional separation is important.

From a construction and cost perspective, keeping the kitchen and bathroom near each other is highly efficient. Both spaces require water supply, drainage, and ventilation, so grouping them reduces pipe lengths, floor penetrations, and construction complexity. In two-storey houses, stacking bathrooms above kitchens or placing them back-to-back vertically is a common and cost-effective strategy. This simplifies maintenance and reduces the risk of leaks over time.

In small houses with limited footprint, clustering wet areas also helps free up better locations for living rooms and bedrooms. When plumbing is concentrated in one zone, other parts of the house can be planned more flexibly, improving layout efficiency and comfort.

However, from a comfort and hygiene perspective, the kitchen and bathroom should not open directly into each other or share immediate visual or circulation space. A bathroom door opening directly into the kitchen is generally uncomfortable and should be avoided. Even a small separation, such as a short corridor, storage wall, stair landing, or change in direction, makes a significant difference in daily comfort and perception.

Ventilation plays a major role in making this arrangement successful. Bathrooms must have independent ventilation, either natural or mechanical, so odors and moisture do not migrate into the kitchen. Similarly, kitchens should have their own exhaust system for heat and cooking smells. When both spaces are properly ventilated, their physical proximity becomes much less noticeable.

Acoustic separation is another consideration. Plumbing noise from bathrooms can be disruptive if walls are thin or poorly insulated. Using proper wall construction, insulation, and careful pipe routing helps prevent sound transmission between the two spaces.

In practice, one of the best arrangements is to place the kitchen and bathroom back-to-back with a shared service wall, but with access from different sides. This keeps plumbing efficient while maintaining functional and psychological separation. Another good option is to place them on the same side of the house or aligned vertically, but separated by a buffer space such as storage or stairs.

In summary, the kitchen and bathroom should be close in terms of plumbing efficiency, but separated in terms of access, views, and ventilation. When designed this way, you get the best of both worlds: lower construction cost and a comfortable, hygienic daily living environment.
