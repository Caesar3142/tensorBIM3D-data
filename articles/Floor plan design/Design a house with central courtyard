## Design a house with central courtyard ##

A house with a central courtyard should be organized around an open-air void placed at the heart of the layout, allowing natural light and ventilation to flow into all surrounding rooms. The main living, dining, and kitchen areas can face the courtyard with large sliding glass doors to create a seamless indoor–outdoor connection, while bedrooms are positioned along the perimeter for privacy but still enjoy courtyard views. Circulation corridors can wrap around the courtyard, making it a visual focal point from multiple angles. The courtyard itself may include greenery, a small tree, water feature, or seating area to enhance tranquility and passive cooling. High walls around the courtyard maintain privacy from neighboring properties, and overhangs or pergolas provide shade and weather protection. This configuration not only improves airflow and daylight distribution but also creates a calm, private oasis within the home.
