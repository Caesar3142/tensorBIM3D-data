## I have 8x15 m land, how should I arrange 3 bedrooms? ##

On an 8 × 15 meter (120 m²) lot, the most efficient way to arrange three bedrooms is typically by building two storeys to preserve comfortable living space and good circulation. The ground floor can accommodate the living room at the front, followed by an open-plan dining and kitchen area, one shared bathroom, and one bedroom that can function as a guest room or room for elderly family members. Placing the staircase along one side wall helps maximize usable space and allows for storage underneath. The upper floor can then contain the master bedroom, a secondary bedroom, and a shared bathroom, with optional small circulation space or study nook. Ideally, bathrooms should be stacked vertically to simplify plumbing, and a small rear yard or light well should be included to ensure natural lighting and ventilation. Keeping bedroom sizes around 2.7 × 3 meters for secondary rooms and about 3 × 3 meters for the master bedroom will maintain comfort while fitting efficiently within the compact footprint.
