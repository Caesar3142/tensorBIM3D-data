If you want the master bedroom facing the garden, the layout should place the master suite at the rear or side of the house where it has direct visual and physical access to the outdoor green area. This arrangement improves privacy, natural light, and ventilation while giving the master bedroom a more relaxing atmosphere.

A practical layout begins with the public areas at the front of the house. The entrance leads into the living room, which can connect to a dining area in an open or semi-open arrangement. The kitchen can be positioned toward the middle or rear but slightly offset so that it does not block the master bedroom’s garden view.

The master bedroom should be placed at the back corner of the house, directly adjacent to the garden. Large sliding glass doors or wide windows can open toward the backyard. If space allows, you can include a small private terrace just outside the master bedroom, creating a semi-private outdoor extension. This works especially well if the garden depth is at least 2 to 3 meters. Morning light and garden views will enhance comfort and create a calm sleeping environment.

The master bedroom can measure around 3.5 × 3.5 meters or larger, depending on the house size. It can include built-in wardrobes along one wall and a private bathroom positioned toward the interior side of the house for plumbing efficiency. Placing the bathroom between the master bedroom and another bathroom can help consolidate wet areas and reduce construction cost.

The remaining bedrooms can be grouped toward the middle or front side of the house. This keeps the master suite separate and more private. A shared bathroom can be centrally located for easy access from the secondary bedrooms.

To enhance the garden-facing concept, ensure there is proper airflow by aligning windows from the master bedroom to another opening on the opposite side of the house. For example, if the master bedroom opens to the backyard, include a high window or ventilation panel on the side wall to allow cross ventilation.

If the lot is wide enough, you can also position the garden along one side of the house instead of only at the back. In that case, the master bedroom can face a side garden courtyard, which increases privacy from rear neighbors and creates a more exclusive feel.

Overall, placing the master bedroom facing the garden works best when it is located at the quietest part of the house, separated from the street-facing areas, with generous openings to greenery and natural light. This arrangement turns the master suite into a private retreat within the home.
