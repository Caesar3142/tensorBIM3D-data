Yes, the living room and dining room can absolutely be combined, and in small or compact houses this is often the best possible solution. Combining these two spaces improves spatial efficiency, reduces wasted circulation, and makes the house feel significantly larger and more open than if the rooms were separated by walls.

In a house with a limited footprint, separate living and dining rooms usually result in smaller, darker spaces connected by corridors or awkward transitions. By merging them into one open-plan area, you eliminate unnecessary partitions and allow the full width and length of the house to be experienced as a single, continuous space. This visual continuity is one of the most effective ways to make a small house feel comfortable rather than cramped.

Functionally, living and dining activities are closely related. Families naturally move between sitting, eating, and socializing throughout the day, so combining these functions reflects real daily behavior. A shared space allows greater flexibility, making it easier to rearrange furniture for different needs such as family gatherings, homework time, or entertaining guests.

Zoning within the combined space is achieved through layout rather than walls. Furniture placement, rugs, ceiling treatments, lighting, or slight changes in floor level or material can clearly define the living area and dining area without physically separating them. For example, placing the dining table closer to the kitchen and the sofa grouping closer to windows or the garden creates a natural and intuitive spatial order.

From an environmental comfort perspective, a combined living–dining space improves daylight distribution and ventilation. Fewer walls mean light can penetrate deeper into the interior, and airflow can move more freely through the space. This is especially important in narrow houses or houses designed to feel cool without air conditioning, where cross-ventilation and openness are key to comfort.

Acoustically, combining the spaces is usually acceptable in residential settings, especially for families. While sound does travel more easily in open plans, this is rarely a major issue for living and dining functions. If some separation is occasionally needed, sliding panels, curtains, or movable screens can provide flexibility without permanently dividing the space.

In practical terms, a combined living and dining area of around 20–30 m² can work very well in a small house, depending on furniture choices and layout. The key is to avoid oversized furniture and to maintain clear circulation paths so the space remains easy to use and visually calm.

In summary, combining the living room and dining room is not only possible but highly recommended for small and compact houses. When designed thoughtfully, a shared living–dining space improves efficiency, comfort, airflow, and the overall sense of openness, making the house feel larger and more livable than its actual size.
