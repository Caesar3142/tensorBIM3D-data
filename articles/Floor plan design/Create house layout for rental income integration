## Create house layout for rental income integration ##

To create a house layout that integrates rental income, design the property with clear separation between the main residence and the rental unit to ensure privacy and independent access. Position the rental unit at the front, rear, or upper floor with its own private entrance, separate utility meters if possible, and basic amenities such as a small kitchen, bathroom, and sleeping area. A compact studio or one-bedroom layout is often most efficient. The main house should maintain its own secure circulation without passing through the rental space. Stack bathrooms and kitchens vertically to reduce plumbing costs, and use good sound insulation between units to improve comfort. Outdoor areas such as parking or small terraces should be clearly divided. By planning for separate access, acoustic control, and independent services, the house can generate rental income while maintaining comfort and privacy for both occupants.
