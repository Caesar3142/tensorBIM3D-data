On a 120 m² plot of land, for example 8 meters by 15 meters, a comfortable and efficient 3-bedroom house can be designed as a single-storey home with a building footprint of around 70–85 m², leaving space at the front for a small terrace and carport and at the back for light, ventilation, and possibly a small service yard. The layout should prioritize good airflow, natural lighting, and clear separation between public and private zones.

The front part of the house can start with a small terrace that functions as a transition space from outside to inside. From the terrace, you enter directly into the living room. The living room can be about 3 × 3.5 meters, positioned at the front left or right side of the house. This space should have a large window facing the front yard to allow daylight and cross ventilation. Adjacent to the living room, without a solid wall to maintain spaciousness, you can place the dining area of around 2.5 × 3 meters. An open-plan concept between living and dining areas helps make the house feel larger than it is.

Behind the dining area, you can locate the kitchen, approximately 2.5 × 2.5 meters or 2.5 × 3 meters. A straight-line or L-shaped kitchen layout along the wall is efficient for a compact home. If possible, the kitchen should have a door or window opening to a small backyard service area for laundry and additional ventilation. This rear open space, even if only 1.5–2 meters deep, is important for light, airflow, and drying clothes.

For the private zone, you can arrange the three bedrooms along one side corridor or cluster them around a small internal hallway. The master bedroom can be placed at the back corner for more privacy, with a size of around 3 × 3 meters. It can accommodate a queen-size bed and a small wardrobe. The second bedroom, about 2.7 × 2.7 meters, can be placed in the middle of the house, suitable for a child’s room. The third bedroom, around 2.5 × 2.5 meters, can be located near the front or center and function as a guest room, study, or small office. Each bedroom should have at least one window, either facing the side setback or the backyard, to ensure proper ventilation and natural light.

A shared bathroom of about 1.5 × 2 meters can be placed between the bedrooms for easy access. If space allows, you can slightly enlarge it to 1.5 × 2.5 meters to fit a shower area, toilet, and small sink comfortably. The bathroom should ideally be positioned against an exterior wall for better plumbing efficiency and ventilation, or equipped with an exhaust fan if it is located in the middle of the house.

Circulation should be kept minimal to maximize usable area. Instead of a long corridor, you can design the layout so that the living and dining areas act as a central hub, with bedroom doors opening from a short internal hall. This reduces wasted space. Storage niches can be built into walls or above door frames to optimize functionality in a compact house.

On a 120 m² plot, if the building footprint is around 80 m², you still have approximately 40 m² for outdoor use. The front 3–4 meters can be used for a carport and small garden, while the rear 1.5–2 meters serves as a utility yard. This balance ensures that the house does not feel cramped and maintains healthy living conditions.

Overall, the concept focuses on a clear zoning strategy: public space in the front, semi-public (dining and kitchen) in the center, and private bedrooms at the side or back. With careful proportioning and open-plan design in the common areas, a 3-bedroom house on 120 m² land can feel practical, comfortable, and efficient without unnecessary complexity.
