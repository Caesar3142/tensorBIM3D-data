## I want split-level design on sloped land ##

A split-level design on sloped land works best by stepping the house along the natural contour rather than forcing a flat platform, reducing excavation and preserving the landscape. The entrance can be placed at mid-level, with a few steps leading up to private spaces such as bedrooms and a few steps down to public areas like the living room and kitchen. This creates natural zoning while maintaining visual connection between levels. Large windows and terraces should face downhill to capture views and daylight, while retaining walls can be integrated into the architecture for structural efficiency. The garage or service areas can be positioned at the lower level if the road sits below, or at the upper level if access is from higher ground. By following the slope, the house gains dynamic interior volumes, better ventilation, and a strong connection to the surrounding terrain while minimizing structural and foundation costs.
