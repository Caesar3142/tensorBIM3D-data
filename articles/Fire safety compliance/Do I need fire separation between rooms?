For a typical two-storey single-family house, you generally do not need formal fire separation between normal rooms such as bedrooms, living rooms, dining areas, or kitchens. In residential houses, these spaces are usually considered part of one fire compartment, and open connections between rooms are allowed. Everyday house layouts are designed to allow free movement rather than being divided by fire-rated walls.

Fire separation becomes necessary only in specific situations, not everywhere. The most common place where fire separation is required is between the house and higher-risk or non-habitable spaces. For example, if you have an attached garage, the wall and door between the garage and the house typically must be fire-rated, because garages present a higher fire risk due to vehicles, fuel, and equipment. Similarly, plant rooms, generator rooms, or storage spaces with flammable materials may require separation from living areas.

Between floors, the floor slab itself usually provides the required fire resistance automatically if it is concrete or properly constructed. You do not normally need additional fire separation walls between rooms on different floors in a single-family house, as long as the structure meets basic fire resistance requirements defined by local codes. This is one reason concrete slabs are popular in residential construction.

Staircases do not usually require fire separation in a single-family two-storey house. Open stairs connecting living spaces are allowed in most residential codes, provided there is a safe means of escape, proper handrails, and bedroom windows that can serve as emergency exits. Fire-enclosed staircases are typically required only in apartment buildings, offices, or taller buildings with many occupants.

Bathrooms, kitchens, and bedrooms do not need to be separated from each other with fire-rated walls in normal houses. However, good practice still applies: kitchens should have proper ventilation, non-combustible finishes near cooking areas, and safe electrical installations. These measures reduce fire risk without requiring full fire separation.

Doors and partitions inside a house are usually not fire-rated unless they separate a higher-risk area. That said, solid doors and proper construction still help slow fire spread and improve safety, even when fire-rated construction is not mandatory. Smoke detection and early warning systems are far more important in houses than internal fire walls.

In summary, for a standard two-storey single-family house, you do not need fire separation between normal rooms. Fire separation is typically required only between the house and higher-risk spaces such as garages or service rooms, and the floor structure itself usually provides sufficient separation between storeys. The focus in residential design is on safe escape, smoke detection, and sensible layout rather than compartmentalizing every room.
