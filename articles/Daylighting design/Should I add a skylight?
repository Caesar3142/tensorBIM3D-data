Yes, adding a skylight can be a very good idea, but only if it is used intentionally and designed correctly. A skylight is most beneficial when it solves a specific problem, such as bringing daylight into spaces that cannot receive light from side windows, rather than being added as a decorative feature alone.

Skylights are especially useful in compact houses, narrow plots, or homes with deep floor plans where rooms in the middle of the house would otherwise feel dark. Placing a skylight above staircases, corridors, bathrooms, or even over a central living area can dramatically improve daylight quality without taking up wall space. Light from above is more evenly distributed and often feels softer than direct side light.

However, skylights can cause overheating if they are poorly designed. Because they receive direct sun for much of the day, an unshaded skylight can become a major heat source. This is why skylights should ideally be shaded, diffused, or oriented to avoid harsh midday sun. Using frosted or translucent glazing helps scatter light while reducing glare and heat. Recessing the skylight or adding an external shading element also makes a big difference.

Ventilation is another important reason to add a skylight. Operable skylights or roof vents allow hot air to escape at high level, reinforcing the stack effect. When warm air rises and exits through the skylight, cooler air is drawn in through lower windows. This is particularly effective in two-storey houses or houses with high ceilings, where heat tends to accumulate near the roof.

Location matters more than size. A small, well-placed skylight often performs better than a large one. Oversized skylights increase heat gain and can cause glare, while modest skylights placed strategically provide sufficient light without discomfort. In bedrooms, skylights should be used cautiously and usually combined with blinds or diffusers to control early morning sun and maintain sleep comfort.

In hot or tropical climates, skylights work best when combined with a ventilated roof or double-roof system. This allows heat absorbed by the roof to be removed before it reaches the interior. Without this, even a well-glazed skylight can contribute to heat buildup over time.

Maintenance is another factor to consider. Skylights require good waterproofing and careful detailing. Poor installation can lead to leaks, condensation, or long-term damage. If construction quality or maintenance access is uncertain, fewer skylights with better detailing are preferable to many poorly executed ones.

In summary, you should add a skylight if you need daylight or ventilation in areas that side windows cannot serve. It is a very effective design tool when kept modest in size, properly shaded or diffused, ventilated if possible, and well integrated with the roof design. When used thoughtfully, a skylight improves brightness, airflow, and comfort without causing overheating.
