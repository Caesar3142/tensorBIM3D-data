Designing window placement for a north-facing house depends partly on your climate, but the general strategy is to balance daylight, ventilation, and heat control while taking advantage of consistent natural light from the north side.

In many warm or tropical regions, north-facing façades receive softer and more stable sunlight compared to east and west. This makes the front of a north-facing house a good place for larger windows, especially for living rooms and dining areas. You can place wide, well-proportioned windows in the front living space to capture steady daylight without excessive glare. Adding a moderate roof overhang helps control midday sun while still allowing light in.

For cross ventilation, do not rely only on front windows. Ensure that there are operable windows at the back of the house as well. Air should be able to enter from the north-facing front and exit from the rear façade, or vice versa depending on prevailing wind direction. Aligning front and back openings creates a straight airflow path. If possible, also include side windows to enable diagonal ventilation.

The rear of the house, which may face south, can accommodate bedrooms or kitchen areas with well-shaded windows. Because the south side may receive stronger sun exposure in some climates, control heat gain with horizontal shading devices such as deeper overhangs. If the south side receives less intense sun in your region, you can use medium-sized windows for balanced daylight.

East and west walls should generally have smaller windows or be carefully shaded. These orientations often receive low-angle morning and afternoon sun, which can cause overheating. If bedrooms are located on the east side, moderate window sizes are acceptable because morning sunlight is usually less problematic. West-facing windows should be minimized or protected with vertical fins, louvers, or vegetation.

For interior spaces that lack access to exterior walls, consider adding high-level windows or clerestory openings facing the north. These provide consistent daylight without harsh solar gain. If privacy is a concern at the front façade, you can raise the sill height slightly while keeping the upper portion of the window large to maintain brightness.

In summary, for a north-facing house, place larger windows in the front living areas to capture stable daylight, ensure aligned rear openings for cross ventilation, control east and west sun carefully, and use shading elements to fine-tune heat gain. Proper distribution of windows on multiple sides will maximize light and airflow while maintaining thermal comfort.
