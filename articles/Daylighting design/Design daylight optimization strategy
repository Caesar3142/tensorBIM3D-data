## Design daylight optimization strategy ##

To optimize daylight in a house, begin by orienting the building to maximize balanced natural light, ideally allowing larger openings on north and south façades (in tropical regions, avoid excessive west-facing glazing). Use well-placed windows on opposite walls to distribute light evenly and reduce dark corners. Incorporate clerestory windows, skylights, or light wells to bring daylight into deeper interior zones without relying solely on side windows. Open-plan layouts and interior glass partitions can help light travel further across spaces. Use light-colored walls, ceilings, and reflective finishes to bounce daylight and enhance brightness naturally. External shading devices such as overhangs and louvers should be designed to block harsh direct sun while still admitting diffused light. By combining orientation, strategic window placement, vertical light sources, and reflective interior surfaces, the house can remain bright and comfortable throughout the day with minimal artificial lighting.
