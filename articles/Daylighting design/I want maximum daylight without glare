## I want maximum daylight without glare ##

To achieve maximum daylight without glare, prioritize indirect and diffused natural light rather than direct sun penetration. Place larger windows on north and south façades (in tropical climates, minimize west-facing glass) and use external shading devices such as overhangs, light shelves, or vertical fins to block harsh direct sunlight while allowing softer reflected light inside. Incorporate clerestory windows or skylights with diffusers to bring daylight deeper into the space without creating bright hotspots. Use sheer curtains, adjustable blinds, or perforated screens to control brightness throughout the day. Interior finishes should be light-colored and matte rather than glossy to reflect light evenly without causing visual discomfort. By combining orientation, shading, diffused openings, and reflective surfaces, you can maintain a bright interior that feels comfortable and free from glare.
