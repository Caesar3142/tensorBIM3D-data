Skylights should be placed where they can deliver daylight deep into the interior without causing excessive heat gain or glare. The most effective locations are areas that are far from exterior walls, such as the center of the house, hallways, bathrooms, stairwells, or interior living zones that lack side windows.

If your house has a rectangular layout, the middle portion often receives the least natural light. Installing a skylight above the central living or dining area can brighten the entire space during the day. Because skylights admit light from above, they distribute illumination more evenly compared to vertical windows. This reduces the need for artificial lighting during daytime.

Bathrooms are another ideal location, especially if they do not have access to exterior walls. A small skylight above the shower or vanity can provide privacy while delivering strong natural light. Similarly, a skylight in a corridor can eliminate the need to turn on lights during the day.

Orientation matters. In many climates, north-facing skylights provide consistent, soft daylight with minimal overheating. South-facing skylights receive stronger sun exposure and may require shading or glazing with low solar heat gain properties. East- and west-facing roof slopes can introduce intense low-angle sunlight, which may increase heat and glare, so careful glazing selection or external shading is important.

To reduce overheating, use insulated, double-glazed skylights with low-emissivity coatings. Operable skylights can also improve ventilation by allowing hot air to escape. Because warm air rises, placing a venting skylight near the highest point of the ceiling enhances stack ventilation and improves overall cooling.

Avoid placing skylights directly above areas where glare could be uncomfortable, such as directly over a television or work desk. Instead, position them slightly offset so that light spreads across the ceiling and reflects downward.

If the ceiling is flat but the roof is pitched, a light shaft can connect the skylight to the ceiling opening. Keep the shaft walls light-colored to maximize reflection and brightness.

In summary, place skylights in the center of the house, over interior rooms without windows, or at high points to enhance ventilation. Orient them for softer daylight when possible, use high-performance glazing, and combine them with shading or ventilation features to prevent overheating while maximizing natural light.
