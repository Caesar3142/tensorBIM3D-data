## Reduce artificial lighting usage during day ##

To reduce artificial lighting during the day, maximize natural daylight penetration through well-oriented windows placed on north and south façades while minimizing harsh west exposure. Use larger, strategically positioned openings and incorporate clerestory windows, skylights, or light wells to bring daylight into deeper interior zones. Keep interior layouts open so light can travel freely between spaces, and use glass partitions instead of solid walls where privacy allows. Choose light-colored, matte finishes for walls, ceilings, and floors to reflect daylight evenly and brighten the space naturally. Install external shading devices to prevent glare while still allowing diffused light inside. Finally, use daylight sensors and zoning controls so artificial lights automatically dim or switch off when sufficient natural light is available, ensuring energy efficiency without sacrificing comfort.
