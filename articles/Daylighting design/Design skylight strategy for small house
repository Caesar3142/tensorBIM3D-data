## Design skylight strategy for small house ##

To design an effective skylight strategy for a small house, use skylights strategically to bring daylight into areas that lack exterior walls, such as bathrooms, corridors, or the center of the floor plan. Position skylights on the roof slope that avoids harsh direct west sun, and consider north-facing skylights (in tropical regions, use shaded or diffused glazing) to provide consistent, soft light without overheating. Use smaller, well-placed skylights rather than one large opening to distribute light more evenly and prevent glare. Incorporate operable skylights or vented roof windows to support stack ventilation, allowing hot air to escape. Adding light shafts with reflective finishes can help direct daylight deeper into the space. Ensure proper flashing and waterproofing to prevent leaks, especially in high rainfall areas. By balancing size, orientation, shading, and ventilation, skylights can significantly brighten a small house without causing excessive heat gain.
