To achieve a bright interior with minimal glare, the key is to prioritize diffused daylight rather than direct sunlight. Brightness and glare are not the same thing. A room can be well-lit without harsh sun beams or strong contrast if the light is softened and evenly distributed.

First, control direct sun exposure. Glare usually occurs when direct sunlight enters at a low angle or when there is a strong brightness contrast between the window and interior surfaces. Use external shading devices such as roof overhangs, vertical fins, or adjustable louvers to block direct rays before they hit the glass. External shading is far more effective than interior curtains because it stops heat and glare at the source.

Second, bring light from higher positions. High windows or clerestory windows allow daylight to enter from above eye level, which reduces direct glare. When light hits the ceiling first and reflects downward, it becomes softer and more evenly distributed. This creates brightness without harsh brightness contrasts.

Third, consider window orientation. North-facing windows in many climates provide stable, indirect daylight that is bright but not intense. East- and west-facing windows are more likely to cause glare due to low-angle sun, so if they are necessary, use shading or smaller window sizes.

Fourth, use light-reflective interior surfaces. A white or light-colored ceiling helps bounce daylight deeper into the room. Matte finishes are better than glossy ones because glossy surfaces can create uncomfortable reflections. Light neutral walls also improve overall brightness without needing oversized windows.

Fifth, consider glazing type. Low-emissivity glass with moderate visible light transmission allows brightness while reducing solar heat gain. Avoid overly dark tinted glass if you want a naturally bright space, but choose glazing that filters harsh ultraviolet and infrared radiation.

Window placement matters as well. Instead of one very large window that creates a strong contrast, use multiple well-distributed windows. This spreads light more evenly. You can also offset windows slightly from seating or working areas so sunlight does not fall directly into the eyes.

If you want even softer daylight, translucent materials such as frosted glass panels or light-diffusing blinds can filter sunlight while maintaining brightness. Sheer curtains are also effective for softening direct sun without darkening the room significantly.

In summary, maximize brightness by allowing abundant indirect daylight, using high and well-oriented windows, reflecting light off ceilings and walls, and blocking direct sun with external shading. When light is diffused and evenly distributed, the interior feels bright and comfortable without glare.
