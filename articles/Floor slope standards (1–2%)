## Floor slope standards (1–2%) ##

Bathroom floor slope standards recommend a gradual incline of about 1 to 2 percent toward the drain to ensure proper water flow and prevent pooling. This means the floor drops approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch per foot (1–2 cm per meter) from the perimeter toward the drain. A consistent slope is essential for all wet zones, including showers, wet rooms, and around bathtubs, to direct water efficiently while maintaining safe, slip-resistant walking surfaces. Excessive slope can cause discomfort or water to flow too quickly, leaving solids behind, while too shallow a slope may result in slow drainage and standing water.
