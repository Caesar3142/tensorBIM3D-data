## GFCI outlets ##

GFCI outlets in bathrooms are specialized electrical outlets designed to protect users from electric shock in wet or damp environments. They monitor the flow of electricity and quickly shut off power if a ground fault or leakage is detected, such as when current flows through water or a person. GFCI outlets are typically installed near sinks, vanities, and other areas where water contact is likely, usually within 6 feet of a water source. They are required by most electrical codes for all bathroom circuits, and regular testing using the built-in test button ensures they are functioning properly. Proper placement and use of GFCI outlets greatly enhance safety in the bathroom.
