## Dining table size standards ##

Dining table size standards ensure comfortable seating and circulation. A standard rectangular table for six seats typically measures about 180 cm long by 90 cm wide, with 60 cm per person along the sides. Round tables of 120–150 cm diameter seat four to six people. Allow at least 90 cm between the table edge and walls or furniture for chair pull-out and walking clearance.
