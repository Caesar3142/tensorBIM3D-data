## Room dimensions for dining ##

Room dimensions for a dining room depend on table size and seating capacity. A minimum room of 3 m by 3.6 m accommodates a table for four with circulation. For six to eight people, plan at least 3.6 m by 4.2 m. Ceiling height of 2.4 m or more provides a comfortable sense of space, especially with pendant lighting.
