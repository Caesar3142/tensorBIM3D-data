## Open plan dining vs enclosed ##

Open plan dining connects the eating area with the kitchen and living room for a fluid, social feel. Enclosed dining rooms offer privacy, noise separation, and a formal atmosphere. Open plans suit casual lifestyles and smaller homes; enclosed rooms work well for formal entertaining and multi-use households.
